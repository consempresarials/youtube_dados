Finally, we have reached 50k subscribers, and for that, thank you so much. But the average views on my channel are just 10 to 15k. Because 3.7 million videos are uploaded Everyday On YouTube 3.7 million In Hindi-language educational content, the RPM (Revenue per Mile), meaning the earnings per 1000 views, is around 10 to 40 rupees. But in foreign countries, or the content that people from abroad watch in English, their RPM is 300 to 800 rupees. You'll find thousands of tutorials on YouTube about how people earn lakhs of rupees, and thousands of motivational videos. But this video is going to be the exact opposite —more like a demotivational one. Motivating someone for the short term is no big deal. That can even be done just with sound design. But that won’t actually have any impact on your life or change your quality of life. The feeling I have after three years, you shouldn't have that. In 2024, choosing YouTube as a career? It could prove to be a big mistake. By creating content on youtube for 2-3 years and by observing fellow creators. I’ll be sharing what I’ve learned And yes, if you're afraid of reality and want to become like those motivational speakers, making money by any means possible, then stop watching this video right now, and don’t forget to hit the dislike button. If you open Instagram or watch any podcast where money is being discussed, you’ll immediately start feeling like a loser. Because nowadays, no one seems to have an income of less than 5 lakhs on social media. Even if you’re earning ₹1 lakh, you’ll still feel like a beggar, because those people are earning 10-15 lakhs per month, and that too at the age of 20. Some are just 13 years old, and some haven’t even come out of their mother’s womb yet. To prove this, they won’t show you their bank balance or their real method of work. by just looking at the dark circles under their eyes, you’ll have to understand They’ll tell you about some mind-blowing business model like dropshipping, video editing agencies, YouTube automation, etc. Tech Burner said something very valuable: "there’s a huge difference between being good and showing on the internet that you’re good." Because of these reels and countless podcast clips, the illusion that’s been created—stay away from it. Otherwise, it will distract you a lot and steal your peace of mind. You won’t even be able to make decisions, and then you’ll end up following their roadmap. Finally, I quit my job and going to live dream life. I left everything for passion— this is becoming a common phrase now. But think about it: a 9 to 5 job doesn’t inherently mean it’s bad. You also need skills and hard work to get it. Make decisions not in excitement but with responsibilities in mind. God gave us enthusiasm along with Brain; sometimes you should use that too. 9 to 5 jobs are called the rat race because you have to follow the same boring routine every day. So, why am I now calling YouTube a rat race? Let's go back a little. I started my YouTube channel out of passion, a passion for clicking photos. When I grew a little, I started making content for the audience because I wanted to grow more. This way, photography faded away. I completely stopped going outside with my camera. I had to shift my full attention towards videography, and I started enjoying that too. But again, to grow in this field, I had to keep doing the same work repeatedly. I started uploading one content piece every week. Gradually, the scripts for the videos became more complex, the editing process became more time-consuming, and now I’ve reached a point where it takes me two to three days to write a script, and it takes me three days to edit a video. So now, what's happening is that I’m spending the entire day in front of the computer screen, locked in a room. After a few days like this, a word starting with “p” completely disappeared. I had said in a video that I’m very happy turning my passion into a profession, but now I realize that’s not the case. Because think about it carefully —if you have to do something you once did out of your own will, but now you have to do it under pressure, repeatedly, your love for it will fade away. You love eating biryani, but if you are given biryani for lunch and dinner every day, after a week, just the name of biryani will make you feel nauseous. This creates the feeling of burnout. Now, some people can balance this life and keep growing with that mindset. And then they fall into the same rat race, which is no different from a 9-5 job, or even worse. Because for the job, you were mentally prepared in advance that you’d have to do this. But for this career, you expected something entirely different. To sustain this, you need capability, which varies from person to person. It would have been easier to sustain if the rewards were better. I’ve already mentioned how much the RPM is for educational content in Hindi. So, if you still want to get trapped in this rat race, do it by being mentally prepared. Look at my situation at first I used to upload four videos in a month, then three, and now I’ve stopped at two. I don't know, maybe it will become one someday. And even now, I’m able to upload this content the only reason  is because of sponsors. And this video is sponsored by HitPaw Video Enhancer, which allows you not only to enhance any video but also repair various types of damages, whether it's flickering, unplayable videos, screen loss, or even restoring sound. So, let's test the video enhancer. Click on 'Import Video File' and select your low-resolution video. Since it's a face video, the automatic face model has already been selected here. Now, just click on 'Preview Effect'. In just a few seconds, the preview will be ready. The enhancement has been done really well, but the color has gotten a little messed up, so we will exit the preview and select 'Soften' for the face model, then tap on 'Preview' again, and as you can see, now it's enhanced perfectly. The original video was in 240p, and we have converted it to 4K. Now, we'll just export it from here. Now, let's look at AI Background Removal. Import a video from here, and after playing the video, you'll notice that it has complex movements. It will be interesting to see how the background is removed in this. Now, just tap on 'Preview'. In a few seconds, you'll get the video with a transparent background, and you can also check the accuracy. You can apply any color to the background from here. Now, just click on 'Export'. Be sure to check out the link in the description for full details. 5-10 years ago, when there weren’t as many smartphone users, everyone used to say, 'You just need one viral video.' Meaning, if one video on your channel goes viral, you’ll be established. But today, that has completely changed. Today, having a viral video isn’t a big deal. Subscriber count has no value today. In the early days, there were a limited number of creators in every niche. That’s why the audience used to subscribe to them and only watch their videos. They would build a brand. But today, in every niche, there are millions of creators. If someone likes one of their videos, they immediately hit subscribe, but no one watches all their videos. Now people have many options, and now there’s also Shorts. So, just watching Shorts consumes the entire day. So now, through long-form content building a brand and identity has become very difficult. Let me show you proof. Alright, maybe I make bad content, that’s why my average views are low. But Anithing has 7 lakh subscribers, and their average views are between 1 lakh and 3 lakh. NSB Pictures has 14 lakh subscribers, but the average views are still between 1 lakh and 3 lakh Ankit Bhatiya has 10 lakh subscribers, and his average views are 2 to 3 lakh. Besides that, many good channels are posting fewer videos due to burnout and the huge fluctuation in views. The simple truth is that the immature audience enjoys being fooled. And if you try to build a brand through short-form content, how many brands will people remember? On Instagram, anyone with 10,000 followers considers themselves to have built their own brand. So today, building a brand and a strong audience base is impossible. Views will always fluctuate a lot, no matter how authentic you are. You must have seen this concept, where a carrot is dangled in front of a donkey, and to eat it, the donkey starts walking and keeps walking. But it never actually reaches the carrot. The owner by using that one carrot, takes advantage of the donkey's struggle Similarly, there are some people who want many struggling creators to exist. And they also have just one carrot, which is the skill of manipulating people's thoughts. 'How to grow your YouTube channel,' 'How to make money.' 'How to make viral videos,' Okay, let's say I'm wrong. But think about it, if their advice actually worked, then why is there a need to make more videos on the same topic? But if you check their channels, Then the first video is: 'How to complete 4000 hours of watch time.' Then, after 2-3 videos: 'How to complete 4000 hours of watch time in one day.' Then, after another couple of videos: 'How to get 4000 hours of watch time with just one video.' Why is there a need to keep doing this? The more you struggle, the more they benefit. You are the product. They'll teach you how to get views on your videos but can't get views on their own videos. These people want as many struggling creators as possible, who will watch their videos to escape the struggle and keep watching forever. My channel only started growing when I stopped following their channels. Mr. Beast always says, 'Just focus on creating the best possible video, that's it.' In their business model, if you want to make money, all you have to do is fool people. Even if you're making 30,000, teach people how to make 500,000 per month. And one thing I don't understand, if a person knows 122 ways to earn millions, why aren't they doing those things themselves? Instead, they're teaching you. It's all about the RPM, dear, the RPM trap. Isn't this something like Ambani quitting business to open a YouTube channel and teach you how to make millions from the telecommunication business? If you don't know anything, just teach people how to make money. So please, stay away from these real vampires who are turning your struggle into their business. Just as not everyone with a white beard is a guru, similarly, people who don’t look at the camera while speaking into a studio mic aren’t necessarily worthy of giving advice. Some advice sounds good but is actually useless. For example: Always be surrounded by rich-minded people; you’ll become like those you associate with. So, if someone’s parents are poor, should you kick them out of your house? a friend who has been with you since childhood just because he is poor or have a poor mentality Will you abandon him ? Advice-givers will only keep giving advice (like me). In difficult times, a friend will be more useful. Life is a race. If life is a race, then the one who dies first wins. So, just die now. Forget this nonsense. Life is life; live it well. What success means to you is something only you will decide. No one eles You can be happy even with less money. Not everyone needs bungalows and BMWs to be happy. Some people are very happy earning 15-20 thousand and living with their family. So stop taking advice from everyone. Try to spend time with family and friends. Remember one thing, you can always earn more money, but the time that has passed cannot be brought back. Respect even a poor person; this is life, and they have experience. Free advise Whatever you do, don't think of building a career solely by starting an editing channel. Freelancers are now looking to shift to full-time YouTube, and creators are looking for freelance work. Living on one bank of the river always makes the other bank look better. After struggling for 3 years, and then changing your decision it's better to be prepared beforehand. There’s no need to leave anything to create content on YouTube. If you have a job, continue with it and do YouTube alongside it. All of these points might not apply to you if you make videos in the entertaining niche. However, if you want to create educational content as a video editor, it’s better to allocate 40% of your time to it while doing other work as well. I am also doing some freelancing work today and thinking of doing something offline as well. Just like COVID-19 halted offline work for a while, some incident might also stop online work Now, every situation has exceptions; if you are very talented, your situation might be different. But I am speaking from the perspective of an average person. And I hope this helps my 10 to 12k viewers In this video, I’ve discussed a lot of good and bad points, with the sole aim of helping some people make their decisions better. So if anyone feels bad about my comments, I sincerely apologize. And for creating different moods in every part of this video, I used different types of lighting, which will also improve your visual storytelling if you watch my cinematography series videos. See you soon in the next video. Until then, bye.
