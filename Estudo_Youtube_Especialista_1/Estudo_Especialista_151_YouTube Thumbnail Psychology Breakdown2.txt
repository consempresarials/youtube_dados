I'm about to reveal our 20 best performing thumbnails of all time and we use this exact same thumbnail psychology to generate over $100,000 for cold em wizard if you want to see that case study it's going to be linked in the top right and it's going to be in the description but I'll get right into it before I go into it though don't steal any of my thumbnails okay I had to go as far as watermarking all of these because people steal these on Twitter it's crazy so first things first Sab subie he's a shark on Shark Tank Australia plus founder at King Kong so here for this thumbnail what we did is we said buy my course please on the right because he was essentially reviewing somebody's coar funnel and then we gave him a bit of a surprise look and then we also put a f minus and some red to really stand out the reason why we put the F minus there is just because he had a lot of things to change in his funnel overall it was good but there was definitely some recurring themes that he had to change one more thing I want to say is that we have four words in the thumbnail the reason why we did this is because if you have four words or less in your thumbnails they'll perform better right ideally you get them as close as you can to zero so next Daniel Fazio co-founder at client Ascension and multiple soft software companies so here what we did was super smart we essentially put a whole sentence in the thumbnail by only using one word steps right so here if you look at this you can clearly tell what the title is about it's three steps to get to 50 CA the method we use to put this entire sentence into a picture is this so pay attention three is just a number right it's not a word so it doesn't count so you read it from left to right so you like three steps and you're obviously going to read three steps first because it's the biggest thing in the thumbnail so it goes three steps and then the next thing you look at is the stripe screenshot cuz it goes crazy so then we say 50 c mon on it and then we also had like some really cool colors going on it really stands out compared to every other thumbnail on his channel and then we also put a green graph showing how his companies are growing over time and then he's also holding a microphone and it's a very high quality picture of them so it just looks insanely professional if you see someone with a microphone you usually think they're important so that's the exact strategy we used here super simple and yeah that's what we did next one here this one we tried to use zero words so what we did is he was explaining demand generation versus like demand capture offers so what that means is like either you're bringing more people into the funnel or you're like converting the people that are already in there so we used icons to show this these were cooking and they still cook so basically if you look at this you won't really know like what the hell he's talking about so you're going to want to click the video and see what these icons mean but if you look at this thumbnail and then you read the title it'll kind of make sense so next in this thumbnail we basically use that same green graph and then we also took Ean gaz's background you can tell by the light and then we added five icons which basically represented the five things he talked about in the video which was the macroeconomics of online business or the economics of online business something like that and he looks insanely serious right he looks like cool composed he's like explaining something the reason why this works is because people see these icons and they're like what the hell is this and then they associate these icons with success because they see the green graph in the background so they just want to watch it right we also had a little bit of red going on on the Contour and on his hair so it look pretty cool and yeah next one this is playing again on that same concept of bringing in an entire sentence into a thumbnail so we were like how to go from 0 to 50K a month and we put a timeline right so you look at this it's like you know what the thumbnail is about right you see a timeline in between his hands you see Zero you see 50 c month These are nice 3D like things in the background Nobody Does that like us so it instantly popped and that video did super good and it booked a ton of calls so next one here is going to be client retention so once again we're using four words or Less in this case we use two words and then you already know what the video is about it's like how to increase client retention got some Stars here to show positive feedback and then he looks super serious he's like counting something so that was pretty cool and then we used a bright background because when you use bright backgrounds it actually makes a significant difference versus dark background so we were doing some split testing see what's up and the light background did better so next is Luke balar this is for a live stream so basically it was a Q&A between Zack Schubert and Luke Belmar so we circled in the background net worth and we xed out some certain things this thumbnail cooked like Zach posted this on his Instagram and everybody was like yo what the hell and yeah I also signed a client off of this thumbnail so somebody saw it and was like yo we need to work together so yeah I already know this thumbnail Cooks unfortunately I don't have data for it because the video isn't public at the moment but yeah next kaib is one of our clients founder at scale clients. 411k month marketing agency so here we're talking about how to use chat gbt to sign clients and also how to use chat gbt for your Facebook ads targeting so we also did another video related to AI we were like how AI automation agencies are a scam this one cooked we also ranked it in search it was going like fourth video in the search bar at one point I think it dropped down towards like seven or eight now but yeah this this one cooked and then here D Rich we're using that same concept of four words or less in the thumbnails and also high quality pictures of the client so here we use numbers to show our outbound system is generating thousands of dollars a day so he's also on the phone so you can clearly see he's making an outbound dial so everything clicked together next thumbnail I love this one cuz Dylan just looks hilarious he's like smashing a laptop so it's like broke you know you're raging and you're making 5 CS from home and then he's on the phone so like it just looks like to make 5 cth you just have to take phone calls which is exactly true he places appointment centers and he also trains them and he places closers so yeah he's basically training people how to become sales reps from home and this thumbnail did really good this is like one of the better performing videos he's had in the last year and then next one this is basically Dylan's story from how he went from $0 per month to 100 C month usually we don't make these sorts of faces with our clients but these were already pre-shot when we onboarded Dylan so he had like his mouth open but it matches up with the theme of the video how it's sort of surprising you know going from $0 per month to 100K month not many people can do that right so next we have Barry Burns founder at top do trading he teaches people how to trade so here we like stop being unprofitable you know you're making 1.2k and then here it's like boom plus 23k and then we also had another one that's like how do you know it's time to quit your job so in instead of putting the word job on the thumbnail it's like we're putting the word into a picture right somebody with a tie he's obviously working a job right and then next is Eddie Chang this one was super good it was essentially just quitting the rat race this one cooked and cuz you know he's in like a hamster wheel and then here he's saying how he regretted going to school you see how we're essentially just taking Concepts and putting them into picture form right so here we're talking about how to start a business with $0 if you look at the thumbnail you won't really get that whole like the whole idea of the video but once you look at the thumbnail catches your attention and then you read the title it all Mak sense right and then next we're talking about how he scaled an Ecom brand from 40K a month to 300K a month in 30 days right this is one of his better case studies and he's using this to lower his closeth rates all that stuff when prospects are searching him up before sales calls they're seeing this case study and they're like okay Eddie knows what he's doing so next we have Zack shart so basically this was one of the better performing live streams on his channel where essentially we're like you have to sell this now and we blurred out Amazon and you can still tell it's Amazon right but like people want to know you know sell what on Amazon or or is it selling Amazon Services you know so they look at this thumbnail and they're like okay and then they read the title and they're like best smma service to sell right now something like that a lot of people don't know you can sell marketing to Ecom brands that are selling on Amazon so there's like Amazon SEO PPC Etc so he was talking about that and then next this is me this is a case study I scaled a coaching offer from 30k month to 75k month using YouTube and this thumbnail cooked right it's insanely simp simple and we use the same format for all our clients where you have the client on the left or the right and you're pointing an arrow towards them and you say how much they're making per month it Cooks right so yeah if you want to see more case studies I have more on my aligning page which
