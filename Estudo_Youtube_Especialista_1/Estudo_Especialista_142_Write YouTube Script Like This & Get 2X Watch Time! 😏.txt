"Okay, so if you can write an engaging script
for your YouTube video, viewers will watch your video for a longer duration, which can
increase video watch time, views, and overall engagement by 10 times. But if there are so many benefits to writing
a good script, then it is also a very challenging task that many YouTubers struggle with. Some can't write a good intro, some end up
with boring scripts, and some find it difficult to start writing a script altogether. So, welcome to the YouTube Script Masterclass. This is a detailed guide where I'll explain
step by step how you can write an engaging script for your YouTube videos from start
to finish, so that the audience will stick to your video, and your audience retention
will significantly improve. Even if you are a complete beginner who has
never written a script before, after this video, you'll be able to write scripts like
a pro. I will show you examples from my videos and
explain how I wrote their scripts. I will also provide some common tips about
writing scripts. So, let's begin. RESEARCH
Okay, if you can't start writing a script, then the main reason behind it might be that
you don't do enough research, and you start writing the script word by word directly. This is not the right way to write a script
because you don't have a set of information in front of you that you can use to generate
ideas and write the script. To research, the first step is to decide the
topic of your video. For example: How to Write YouTube Titles with
ChatGPT. Now, whatever the topic is, I first write
it as a heading on top of the page. For research, I recommend using a diary or
a copy because while researching, you will have many ideas in your mind, and if you write
them down on paper, you can express them better. After writing the topic of the video, now
it's time to write all the sub-topics in bullet points that you will explain in your video. For example: I needed to explain how to write
titles with ChatGPT, so I thought about the individual topics to cover in it and started
writing them down one by one. Like: the first point was whether writing
titles with ChatGPT will get more views. The second point was how to write titles with
ChatGPT, like what are the prompts, etc. And the third point was how to customize those
titles according to the YouTube algorithm. In this way, you need to mention all the sub-topics
that will come under the main topic. Similarly, for my video on 5 mistakes that
YouTubers make, I did the same: wrote the main heading and then listed all the sub-topics
in bullet points like wrong niche, bad audio, poor branding, etc. After writing these main points, I left enough
space so that I could write the sub-points under each main point. For example, under the first point, which
is wrong niche, I wrote sub-points like why YouTubers select the wrong niche, the disadvantages
of the wrong niche, and how to select the right niche, etc. Keep writing all the important sub-points
that come to your mind. Keep doing this, and you'll see that you have
written your research in a structured format. Now, see how easy it will be to write the
actual word-by-word script based on this research. But if you want to make a video based on just
these bullet points, congratulations, your script is ready. WRITING:
Okay, till now, what we have written is the research work. Now, let's talk about how to write the actual
script. If you have some basic knowledge about scripting,
you'll know that a YouTube script mainly has 3 parts: the intro, the content in between,
and the end with the call-to-action (CTA). The content part is the most important, of
course, because if you don't provide value in your video, what's the use? But even if you write the best content, if
your intro is weak, people will leave your video in the beginning. That's why, when I write a script, if I spend
10 hours on it, I spend 2-3 hours just on writing the perfect intro. For an engaging intro, you should keep in
mind that whatever you write, it should make viewers want to continue watching your video. This is called an intro hook. There are many ways to write an intro hook,
so I'll tell you 3 of them: No.1 & My Favorite: Hook people by talking
about their situation. Basically, you need to think about who your
video is targeting (meaning who is your target audience) and then think about which problem
you are solving for them (meaning what). Then, you need to say something related to
that problem that will make your video's target audience relate to it. For example: I have a video called Increase
Subscribers on YouTube By DOING THIS. Now, the target audience of this video is
YouTubers whose problem is that their subscribers are not increasing. So I thought about something like this for
the intro: Here's the word-by-word translation of the
YouTube script in English: "So, as you saw, I tried to say something
relatable at the beginning of the video, which made viewers connect with the video, and this
made them feel that because I know their problem, I also have a solution to that problem, which
hooks the viewer! You will see the same thing in many YouTubers'
intros. For example, take a look at Algrow's community
post video. The target audience of this video is YouTubers,
and their query is how to use community posts. Now, see how, by paying attention to these
things, an emotion of FEAR is cleverly created in the viewers' minds in the intro of this
video. [Video plays] It is not necessary that you always solve
the viewer's problem in every video. For example, if you are making a documentary
about a person, what problem will you solve in that? In that case, you can use hook no.2: Make
them curious. Basically, you have to make the viewers curious
by creating a question in their minds. For example, see Dhruv Rathee's video on the
theory of evolution at 28 seconds: [Video plays]
As you saw, Dhruv Rathee sparked a very good question in the viewers' minds, which hooked
them. Hook no.3: The Story Method. If there is one guaranteed method to hook
people, it is by telling a story. That story can be a real-life incident, a
fictional story, or anything, as long as it is related to the video's topic. So, again, there is no fixed formula for writing
an intro that you have to follow, but what I have mentioned are common elements in all
of them, and that is to grab the viewers' attention, intrigue them, or create an emotion
like fear, anger, or urgency in their minds. Now, another thing is that no matter how you
write the intro, make sure it is always under 90 seconds and ideally under 30 seconds. After you have written the intro hook, now
it's time to write the middle part, which is the content. Now, since we have already done the research,
writing the rest of the script will be easy because we already have the points; we just
need to elaborate on them. For this, let's take an example from this
video, which is "5 mistakes new YouTubers make." In this video, point no.2 is "bad audio,"
and I have already written its sub-points. Let's now convert it into the actual word-by-word
script. So, as you can see, the first sub-point is
that "audio is the most important thing for YouTube." I could have started directly with the first
line, saying, "Dosto audio kharab hai to use jaldi fix kro because audio is important,"
but that would have been quite boring, and the message I wanted to convey to the viewers
would not have had the same impact... So, see how I started this point: "An new YouTuber has to work on many things
in their initial days, such as lighting, audio, camera quality, editing, and much more. But if you ask me which one is the most important
among them all, I will say 'Audio.' I cannot stress enough how crucial good audio
is." Now that I have mentioned that audio is important,
in the 2nd sub-point, I have to explain why it is important, right? So, here I have also explained it: "Any viewer
can watch a low-quality video with mediocre editing if the audio is good. Whereas, the reverse is not true." And finally, the 3rd sub-point is "how to
fix bad audio," and I have also explained it: "Like I said earlier, 'What if you don't
even have a microphone? How do you record good audio without one?' Well, I have explained how you can record
good audio even without a microphone... You can pause the video to read it in detail." So, in this manner, you have to elaborate
on each point based on your research. And, of course, don't expect perfect lines
to come to your mind right away, especially if you're a beginner. It will require some patience. Also, when you write scripts, do it on some
digital platform; for example, I write my scripts in the notes app on my phone. This way, if you need to make any changes
later, you can do it easily. Now, try to create a connection between the
different points you explain in your video. This will greatly improve your storytelling. For example, in my video about "How to Write
Titles with ChatGPT," there are 2 points. The first one is "how to write titles with
ChatGPT," and the second one is "how to alter the raw title to make it a good title according
to the YouTube algorithm." To connect these two points, I wrote, "Now
that you have found a title in step 1, the question is, should you use that title or
not? This is where step 2 comes in: 'Altering the
Raw Title.' This way, the impact of my video's message on the viewers is greater,
and of course, audience retention will increase. So try to create a question related to the
next point in the viewers' minds before you start talking about a new point. This way, they will find the answer to that
question in the next point. In this way, you can connect different points. After you have written the content part, finally,
we come to the CTA, which is Call to Action, meaning an action that you want the viewer
to take towards your channel after watching your video. You can tell viewers to like the video, subscribe
to your channel, or leave a comment. You can do all of this, but the best CTA on
YouTube is to ask viewers to watch another video of yours by using end screens. To smartly incorporate end screens into your
script, you have to give viewers a reason to click on them. So, whatever topic you are making a video
on, find another video on your channel that is related to that topic and think about what
you can write there to send viewers to that other video. For example, in this video, "Increase Subscribers
on YouTube by Doing this," where I give 4 tips about increasing subscribers, at the
end, I wrote, "Alright, you got the 4 tips to grow your subscribers, but what if you
are not getting any views on your channel? In such a case, chances are you are making
some common mistakes that every new YouTuber makes. I mentioned views here, and then I wrote,
"If you want to know about these mistakes, click on the video on the screen." And then, on the screen, I had my 5 mistakes
video in the end screen. So, you have to think smartly about what you
can say that is related to your current video, and you
can then use end screens there. IMPORTANT POINTS
Okay, so you have learned how to write a script; now let's talk about some important points
that will help you in writing the script. First is to use the right language to connect
with your audience. When writing the script, make sure that the
words you use or the language you use is suitable for your target audience. For example, I know that my target audience
is mostly young people, so I use light and friendly words, and I also write my script
in a mix of Hindi and English because I think my target audience can relate to it the best. Second is to be disciplined. When we write a script, many times we don't
get the right ideas or words. In such a situation, most people get frustrated
and start procrastinating, like opening Instagram and watching reels, etc. But you shouldn't do that. You have to decide a time for writing the
script, and during that time, you should not get distracted. Even if you don't have any ideas or words
for the script, you have to sit and think. The longer you think about the topic, the
more ideas your brain will generate related to that topic. So, focus is very important. Once you get focused in the beginning, you
will achieve a flow state, and generating ideas will become easier for you. Third, take your time and avoid perfectionism. I'm sure many of you are complete beginners
who have never written a script before. I remember 2-3 years ago, when I wrote my
first word-by-word script, it took me about 4-5 days to write a script for a 5-minute
video. I'm not saying it will take you the same amount
of time, but it's quite common for beginners to face this challenge. So, take your time and avoid perfectionism. Fourth, focus more on the first half of the
video than the second half. If a viewer starts watching your video and
completes the first half, you don't have to do much to grab their attention in the second
half. Because, capturing the viewers' attention
requires more effort in the beginning. Once a viewer is halfway through the video,
even if your video is not that engaging, most people who have made it that far will watch
the entire video. So, I'm not saying you can write anything
in the second half, but I'm saying that your focus should be more on the first half
of the script. Alright, you have made it this far, so comment
