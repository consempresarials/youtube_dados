is how to make great thumbnails for YouTube in just five minutes let's start the timer here we go the first thing we want to do is get the shot so for this video got a basketball this is my little prop we are making a hypothetical YouTube thumbnail for a video called how to shoot like Steph Curry so I want to actually record this on my phone and I'm gonna not use the self timer I just think it's gonna be easier and faster if I shoot in 4k at 60 frames per second I'm going to hit record and 60 frames per second is going to be more pictures within the second for me to choose from so got my light right here I'm just going to hit a couple poses maybe like I'm shooting the ball I just want to hit a few different angles you don't want to just settle for one and then you can see what looks best later so I'm gonna hit a few more maybe this side okay we have four minutes left a little over four minutes so I'm gonna stop filming here and now I'm gonna open this up and I'm gonna send this over to my laptop so we are going to airdrop this I'm gonna hit next airdrop I'm gonna send this to my laptop where I'm gonna then going to edit on canva thank you very much canva for sponsoring this video and they make it super easy actually to edit thumbnails and I'll show you some of my favorite features here but as the timer is just ticking down I'm gonna open up canva.com hit create a design then we're gonna go to YouTube thumbnail now that this is open we are going to find this uh video that I just sent to myself and from here I'm going to open this up I'm then going to scrub through this and I'm going to find the image that I want to use for my thumbnail so this one looks pretty good the ball is kind of cut off right there so maybe I'll use it right about there but I also hit a few more options so I'm over here and it's ball is kind of shattering my face so I'm going to use this one right here looks perfect so I'm going to go ahead and pause and then scroll rub over oof this is great so now we have a very high quality you know definitely high quality enough for YouTube of a photo for a thumbnail so I'm going to use that screenshot now and pull this into go to my desktop and I'm going to pull this in right here perfect so now with this inside of canva I'm just going to make this a bit bigger I'm going to go to edit photo and this is one of my favorite features in canva is we're going to hit the background removal and it literally just takes a few seconds you can see how clean this looks now we only have two minutes and 15 seconds left so we need to keep going basically what I want to do at this point is add in my background I'll make this a little bit bigger I'm going to add in my background so I'm going to go on Google I'm going to type in outdoor basketball court and from here I'm just going to find a good image that I can throw behind me and something that is pretty simple this one's going to be perfect so I'm going to copy this image I'm going to throw it into canva I'm going to paste it right here and then I'm going to right click and we are going to put this backwards I'm going to send it backwards I'm going to make this a lot bigger and you can see this is already looking pretty cool for just a few minutes spent like this is already looking uh amazing and so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna blur the background to help me kind of pop off the background a bit more more and canva makes it super easy there's these effects down here there's a blur option so I'm going to click blur and from here I can just change the intensity feel like that looks really good so now this is just uh nice and beautiful I'm going to click back on my image and I'm going to go to the adjustments and from here this is where I can change the color I can change the brightness and that's what I'm going to do is see you know the color temperature I can make it a little bit warmer I think that looks pretty good I can change the brightness here I'm going to maybe add in some more contrast I think that's going to look a little bit better a little more contrasty and we can mess around with the saturation maybe actually bring the brightness down just a little bit more and the contrast down just the hair and then once you dial that in I like to add a little bit of sharpness not too much but this just makes it easier to see on YouTube when they're super tiny it's hard to see so with 40 seconds left let me add in some text I'm gonna go to text I'm just going to throw this one in right here and I'm going to change this to shoot like Steph Curry and this is already looking pretty great I'm going to delete this one down here um and honestly this is looking really good I want to change it to White and that looks awesome but we do want to go to effects add in a nice shadow I can change the blur here we definitely want the shadow to be black and this is looking really really cool being a little bit closer bring the transparency up and I can even change it to the font we use at think media which is this one dang this is looking fire with three seconds left this is a really good YouTube thumbnail that we just made in five minutes and it looks really really good so if you want to try canva out make sure you use the link down in the description thank you so much for sponsoring this video I love canva for
