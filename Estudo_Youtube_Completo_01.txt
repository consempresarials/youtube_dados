====== Estudo_Especialista_100_I studied 100 faceless channels to CRACK the Algorithm ====== 
I analyzed over 100 faceless YouTube channels across several different niches to decode the algorithm and figure out why some faceless channels like this one this one and this one become massively successful while other channels like these fail to even get off the ground and I found that most successful faceless creators apply a very specific formula to their videos one that we have also applied to this very channel to create viral faceless videos like these so what is this formula that helps them get great results again and again what do these successful creators know that 99% people don't the best faceless YouTube videos follow four simple steps and in this video I am going to walk you through them all make sure you stick around till the end because I'll also show you how you can use AI to put these steps into action and create epic faceless videos in minutes without ever having to script record or edit anything the first step is by far the most important and also the most overlooked and that that is your idea you could have the best video in the world on making little wooden dolls but if nobody wants to watch a video on making little wooden dolls how are you going to get any views during my research I found that most faceless channels that fail have a very self-centered approach to picking ideas they'll think of topics that matter to them or that they find appealing and therein lies their biggest mistake what you want to do instead is pick ideas that people are interested in watching and the best way to find these ideas is to steal them let's get honest you are not creating a faceless channel to express your creativity you are most likely making it because you want to make money and turn it into a passive Revenue source so you want to create videos that will help you do that quickly start by finding as many reference channels in your niche as possible and figure out what topics have worked for them in the past 2 to 3 months ones that have gotten them at least 2 to 3x the views of their subscribe account that is exactly what we did with this video right here and it clearly paid off now once you have a list of potential topics you want to filter that list based on a couple of different parameters number one is there a Content Gap in the videos put out by competitors if you have some information that will be valuable for users but others have not covered it it can be a great idea to start with second is the topic evergreen or trendy trendy topics stay relevant only for a little while like our videos on bulk creating YouTube shorts if you're a beginner and it takes time for you to execute it's better to start with more Evergreen ideas instead and third how quickly can you execute the idea initially when you start your faceless YouTube channel it's a quantity game which means you need to produce videos consistently and produce enough of them to get on the algorithm's radar and get it to start pushing your content out you can't do that if it takes you a month to create your videos that brings us to our second most crucial step creating the packaging for your video that is your thumbnail and your title you could have created the best video in the world but if nobody clicks on it is it really worth the effort for most beginner faceless as creators thumbnails and titles are an afterthought most people will come up with the idea script the video edit the video and just think of a title and thumbnail when they are uploading but if you look at successful faceless channels you will see they have kickass thumbnails for most such channels they don't even have a face on the thumbnail which means the idea needs to be conveyed completely through design by the way there's no harm in putting your own face on thumbnails even if it is a faceless Channel we did that on inv video and it really helped our Channel's growth but if if you don't want to be on camera at all you need to spend time designing your thumbnail and coming up with your title before you even start making your video again go back to your reference channels and look at what kind of ideas have worked well for them there's no need to copy but take cues from how they design and place different elements on the thumbnail where your attention goes when you first look at it and then work from there now when it comes to the title you want to keep the most important information in the first 50 characters and try multiple iterations to see which title generates the biggest sense of four more or fear of missing out and your thumbnail needs to complete the story that you're telling through your title avoid having the same text and the title and the thumbnail design them to complement each other like in these examples you can take the help of in videoos thumbnail maker on the GPD store to generate images and elements for your thumbnails and put these together in Photoshop or canva coming over to step three which is where the magic lies now you have a killer idea and an epic thumbnail and title so people are primed to click on your videos but how do you get them to stay how do you get them to continue watching that can be achieved by your script the way you present your information in the video now there are several different ways to script your YouTube videos but the most successful faceless channels follow this format and once you understand it you can apply it to any video you want most placess videos will see a dip in the first 30 seconds of the video their graph looks something like this the more people stop watching within the first 30 seconds the less your video will get pushed out by by the algorithm so how do you increase the number of people who stick around start with thumbnail alignment your title and your thumbnail set the expectations for your video and if the first 5 Seconds of your intro don't align with those expectations people are going to click away and these initial 5 seconds are crucial check out these intros my faceless Instagram accounts have generated over 500 this is a little compilation of some pretty creepy videos I found on the internet all of them match the expectations set by the tial app and thumbnail and so people know they haven't been misled and so they want to watch further and a very easy way to do this is to have your first sentence match the title next comes your hook the promise you make at the beginning of the video that compels people to stay basically how can you make people curious now popular faceless creators use three main types of hooks one is question hooks like are you tired of your videos getting zero views despite your best efforts second is context hooks where they set the context of the video up front like I started a brand new YouTube shorts Channel and got 40K views in a month and the third is controversial statement hooks or strong statement hooks where Creator say something outrageous to grab attention and then later explain everything like this one right here every day more companies are announcing that they will no longer be requiring a college degree to get a job with them then we have the rest of the intro here you need to give context a about the video while still being crisp and try to exceed the expectations set by your title and thumbnail basically promise to deliver more value than what the viewer initially expected like this intro right here my shorts channel has over 20 million views and many viral videos but my recent shorts aren't really doing well most of them stuck after getting that first a few thousand views now just because the intro is done does not mean that you can skim on the rest of the script if you want YouTube to push your videos you want to retain people in the video for as long as possible you do this by breaking down your content into bite-sized points and then for each point making sure you present the most important piece of information towards the end once you understand how to write a killer YouTube script you can get an AI tool to generate the basic structure and then fine-tune it according to what you know this brings us to the fourth and the final step now most unsuccessful faceless channels out there fail because they're unable to maintain consistency in posting and producing a good Baseline quality of videos the only way to beat this is to have a Dependable system to to lean on when things get tough the good news is that with the Adent of AI creating this system has become easier than ever this makes it super easy for you to get your videos out on time and massively reduces the time and effort needed to create a high quality output let me show you one such AI tool that can be your video co-pilot and can help you get the first draft of your video out in under 10 minutes and from there you get your final publish ready video in another 10 minutes the tool I'm talking about is in video AI it can take a simple text prompt and turn it into a publish ready video in your own voice in under 5 minutes let me show you how I'm going to start by signing into my account on ai. invideo.io and first create an AI version of my own voice simply click on this button down here that says clone your own voice and upload an audio file off your voice on the next page you can simply record this on your phone or your laptop using the script that I've shared in the description below make sure to give nid AI vocal permission to use your voice once you upload your file nid will ask you for certain permissions and then clone your voice in seconds here's mine and it's named Al now let's go back to the homepage and we are going to start creating our video for this I'm going to click on YouTube explainer as the workflow and here I'm going to put in my topic the things Thomas Edison didn't invent but took credit for anyway I'm going to specify the title give it instructions on the intro the tone of voice language and face and then I'm going to share a reference article link within video to pick information from so that the info is accurate from the start next I'm going to choose the voiceover here I'm just going to click on the my voice option and choose the recorded voice I want to use and finally I am going to write what kind of music I want and we are going to hit generate in video will ask me for a few more details on the audience and the look and feel I want for the video and once I select those here is the first draft in just a couple of minutes Thomas Edison the man hailed as one of the greatest inventors of all time had a knack for more than just inventing he had an uncanny ability to borrow ideas put his own twist on them and call them his own from light bulbs to electric chairs the list of borrowed ideas is longer than you might think so buckle up as we unravel the truth behind Edison's so-called inventive streak that actually looks great for an AI generated video but now let's take our learnings from the first three steps and put those into action and edit this video slightly to make it great I am going to start by simplifying the language because simpler languages are more effective in keeping people engaged and for that I am just going to prompt in video using this prompt box right here to do so oh did you know Thomas Edison was known for um taking others ideas and making them his own many people see him as a great inventor but he also had a talent for changing other people's ideas and then claiming them as his own sounds much better doesn't it I'm also going to ask in video to remove any fumbles we hear in the voiceover did you know Thomas Edison was renowned found for adapting others ideas and making them his own many see him as a brilliant brilliant inventor sounds great now I want to make some specific changes to the intro according to what we learned before for that I am going to click on the edit option right below the canvas and here I'm going to choose the edit script option and here I am going to change the intro to make it more crisp to improve the hook and make it aligned with my title and thumbnail now I also going to trim the rest of the script a little bit this took me about 10 minutes or so to do and then I am going to click apply Thomas Edison's name is associated with many titles genius Mastermind invention Thief doesn't that sound so much better similarly if you want to make any changes to specific media clips that are there in the video you can do that using the edit media option here you either upload your own Clips like I uploaded these pictures of edit or you search the stock library for more stock Clips as soon as you click on the new clip it will get placed on top of the original meaning that it has been replaced now let's take a look at our final results Thomas Edison's name is associated with many titles genius Mastermind invention thief in our history books Thomas Edison is considered one of the greatest inventors of all time but the list of inventions he stole is just as long as his actual inventions and today we're telling you about all of those things said that Thomas Edison didn't invent but took credit for anyway let me know in the comments what you thought of this final clip now once you're happy with the results just go ahead and click on export and keep in mind that voice cloning and Watermark free exports are available only on the paid plan which starts as low as $20 a month but given that you get an insanely powerful video editor for the price it's a bargain so go ahead try applying these principles to create your own videos using in video Ai and don't forget to check out this video next to learn how we blew up a YouTube shorts channel in just 30 days

====== Estudo_Especialista_101_I Studied 5,400 YT Shorts to Crack the Algorithm ====== 
I analyzed over 5 500 YouTube shorts across 34 different niches to try and decode the algorithm and figure out the best way to go viral and I want to show you what I found so here's how it all happened so the other day I was scrolling through Twitter procrastinating as usual and I came across this tweet from Paddy Galley now Patty is a YouTube expert who has generated billions of views with a b and worked with huge creators including lord Jimmy and basically Paddy's tweet broke down a massive study that he and his partner did to decode the YouTube shorts algorithm and despite the fact that most YouTube analytics studies make most people feel a little bit like an Edward Munch painting but the findings in this study are actually so profound that it got a huge amount of views and even Elon Musk did A celebratory live stream in 144p just in its honor all jokes aside though this study is actually a real thing so today I want to Deep dive and expand on it so by the end of this video you will have everything you need to know to start making viral shorts that get you you more subscribers make you more money and get you lots of girlfriends so a quick note though even though this video is probably titled or introd something like I analyze 3.3 Billion YouTube shorts to crack the algorithm I want to make it very clear that all the credit and insights for this study are 100 with Patty and his team I didn't have anything to do with it I just needed a clickable YouTube title so please don't sue me Patty anyway with that out of the way let's get into this because this is fascinating stuff now this study had five massive findings that will help you get more views with your shorts but before we can get into those you need to actually understand a little bit about how the YouTube shorts algorithm actually works and the best way to understand this is from the perspective of a viewer so if you're a viewer opening up YouTube shorts for the first time ever what YouTube's gonna do because it has no data on you it's gonna send you random General popular shorts that's going to measure which ones you engage with so which ones you watch which ones you maybe like and comment on and it's going to gradually start to build up a profile on what type of content you'd like then once it has an idea of what kind of content you like is going to explore that Niche for the best shorts in it and we'll talk more about what best means in a second and it's going to try and feed you those shorts because those shorts are going to be more likely to keep you on the YouTube platform for as long as possible binging your life away which makes YouTube money so let's say for example whenever YouTube happens to show you a cricket show you really engage with that shot you watch it all the way to the end you like it you comment on it the algorithm is going to take notice of that and eventually it's going to be like hey let's search our YouTube library for other videos of Sports and send them to this person and see if they also engage with them so you'll find yourself getting more Cricket shorts you might get some badminton in there maybe some baseball you know the real like lowest of the low but as we mentioned previously there are probably a lot of cricket shorts and baseball shorts and badminton shorts so how is YouTube know which ones to serve to you so it's going to find the best shorts in those categories and give those ones to you first because those ones are going to be the most likely to keep you on the platform and this is where we can start to get into what best actually means because if we take a step back from this example and put ourselves back in the shoes of the Creator your job is to have your shorts be perceived by the algorithm as the best because that means that your shorts are going to be the ones that are most likely to be pushed to viewers first which means you'll get the Lion's Share of the views subscribers and all that good stuff but instead of me just telling you what the best is I actually want to show you some data on this so here is a spreadsheet full of YouTube shorts data from real YouTube shorts and if some of you are watching this right now I wonder how you can get a spreadsheet of die like this as you come to your channel and you go to analytics and in analytics you find that the analytics that you actually want the data of let's say I just wanted the overview I come to overview I'd click see more it's going to open up a more advanced analytics panel and then you come up here to this download button and you can pick which stats you want to download into a spreadsheet and which ones you don't by clicking on this plus button here and then adding say different columns to your report and then once you're happy with your report you can't appear and you click on this download button it'll export your data so back to as you're about to see this data can give us some really interesting insights so in this shade each one of these roads is an individual short so what I'm going to do is come across to average view duration here which is on average how long did a viewer watch particularly short for and what I'm going to do is I'm going to sort from z2a which is going to order this sheet in a way that the shorts with the highest average view duration are going to come at the top and then the shorts the lowest average view duration will be sorted to the bottom and once we've done that grab the views here so from here I'm going to highlight just down this is a really basic analysis and click down here and grab the average what you can see is that on average the top 26 shorts from this Channel with the highest average view duration have about 3.2 million views on average now if I change this and sort this to A to Z this is going to give us the lowest average view duration shorts with the lowest one having just nine seconds and then I do the exact same thing I grab our top 26 videos and look at the average has plummeted the average amount number of views here is now about seven hundred thousand this channel has some pretty good shots on it so even it's worst short to do pretty well but 700 000 is nowhere near 3.2 million so what this is telling us is that if you have a higher average view duration not just see your short but actually watch it for a long amount of time YouTube algorithm sees that as a positive signal that that sure is a good shot and makes it more likely that that shot's going to be pushed out to more viewers I know this is really basic and obvious stuff but often we're always looking for the hacks and I think we need to start on a foundation of what are the fundamentals that really matter and clearly seeing the data here the average view duration is one of those and Paddy's study also backs this up for example this is a graph that encompasses 33 different YouTube channels across different niches and you can see the averages it looks pretty similar right with shorts between an average view duration of 50 and 60 seconds on average got 4.1 million views think about that so in essence if your short can maintain an average view duration of between 50 and 6 60 seconds especially as it scales chances are on average you're going to get about 4 million views but that's a lot easier said than done so how can you actually do that well our study has some insights in this as well I want to come back to this channel here and show you something else very interesting so if we sort out views again Z to A which is going to give us the top viewed shorts on this channel and if we come across to the duration of this shot so this is an average of iteration this is how long each shot is let's have a look through some of these numbers so we've got 45 seconds 59 seconds 52 seconds 54 seconds we keep going down this list we'll see there's only about three shorts in this entire list that are in the 30 seconds or below and even those shorts two of them are like 37 seconds so they're like close to 40 seconds anyway however if we come into views and we sort this the other way around to the shorts with the lowest amount of views I want you to have a look at this column again look at how these numbers have changed right we've got a number of shorts in the 30 seconds and below I can just see 10 from eyeballing this but in general if you just look over this you can can see that on average the shorts that performed worse tend to be shorter no pun intended than the shorts that are longer and interestingly this is also backed up by Paddy's study as well so you can see on this graph the shorts that Paddy analyze most of them were between 30 and 40 seconds you can see shorts between 50 and 60 seconds performed far better than their shorter counterparts now why is this well again with the caveat that people are actually watching your shots because if you just post a long shot no one watches it then it doesn't matter but a longer short has the opportunity to get more of the Thing YouTube cares about most which you know is high watch time for that shot if you're posting a 30 second short chances are your most engaged viewer will probably watch that short all the way to the end so you'll get about 30 seconds of watch time now some really engaged viewers if you're a little bit sneaky and loop your short might watch your short one and a half times maybe even two or three times but that's the vast minority right on the other hand if you have a short that's double the length so not 30 but 60 seconds most of your most engaged viewers will watch that shot all the way to the end the difference is is an Engaged viewer watching your show all the way to the end on a longer shot gives you one minute of watch time as opposed to just 30 seconds so a way to think about this is that the longer short has the opportunity to get more watch time and a higher average view duration than a shorter shot just inherently it does due to length now obviously there are outliers you can see it in my data for example this shot is one of the worst performing shorts on this channel and it is 51 seconds a reason for that could be as you can see the average view duration for this short isn't actually so great but regardless in general if your content is really high quality you're going to have better results if you create a longer short between 50 and 60 seconds versus a shorter short but we're just getting started here because the study found something really interesting with a stat you might not have ever heard of called vvsa AKA viewed versus swiped away essentially if you go to say one of your shorts through content and then come down to the analytics of it by clicking on say this button and then come across to the reach tab what you'll see is this little box box here how many choose to view which is your vvsa think about it for those of you who know click-through rate for long form videos it's basically like your click-through rate but for shorts because on shorts most people don't really click on them they find them in the shorts feed so one of the big colors for shorts is not how many clicks it can get but rather whether or not people will actually watch it versus swipe away from it so essentially what this measures is the percentage of people who actually watched your short when they came across it in the feed versus the people who'd kind of just landed on it and swiped away from it because they weren't that interested so this is a decent metric to look at if you want to gauge the quality of your shorts hooks whether or not you're able to actually really grab someone's attention the first couple of seconds because if you can't do that you're not going to watch the remainder of the short and they're going to swipe away and that's obviously bad but let's get some real numbers on this now if we come back to our data and we have a look at this column here which is a viewed versus swiped away we just get a quick gauge of it you can see that on average for these lower performing shots the viewed versus swiped away is about 70 so on average 70 of people watch the a short rather than swiping away from it and that's decent which explains why even the lowest performing shorts on this channel still manage to get a large amount of Impressions and Views however if we change this and again we sort by the highest performing shorts what we can see is the viewed versus swiped away stat changes a little bit so now we can say it's gone up 10 and on average it's 80 and that might not seem like a big change but when you're competing against so many shorts and you're trying to be the Pinnacle you're trying to be the best in your Niche so you get served first a 10 difference can be a big difference and the study found some interesting insights on this if we have a look at this graph this is kind of laying out all the different videos and shorts that this study analyzed based on vvsa what you can see down here in this corner if we move across this line you can see that if you have a vvsa less than 40 like chances are your short is not going to get more than 10 000 views on the other hand if you're having a vvsa between 70 and 90 your shorts could be getting hundreds of thousands of views as you can see in this kind of green section here now does just having a high vvsa guarantee that your shot is going to get hundreds of thousands of views not necessarily for example if we come to the channel you're watching right now which I'm going to out myself here but um and we come down to one of the few shorts that I've posted click on it we come across to reach you can see this short has almost 90 percent vvsa and yet this short only has 10 000 views so it's not a guarantee that you're gonna get hundreds of thousands of views but based on the data we can see I would still think it's useful to look at this stat and kind of treat it as a you must check this box in order to have the chance to go viral in other words you can see if you're getting less than 40 vvsa like the chances of you really blowing up are pretty much nil however if you're getting more than that that doesn't guarantee you're gonna blow up but at least the door is open and there's a potential assuming you do some of the things we talk about later in this video and also the things we talked about earlier but with all this being said obviously we can see that the competition for shorts is getting tougher and tougher it's no longer the wild west so a short even worth doing well if we have a look at more data from Paddy's study what we can see here the number of Subs gained per 10 000 views for YouTube shorts versus long form videos and what you can see is really interesting is that audio overall across all of the channels that Paddy studied on average long form videos actually got more subscribers per view than short so per 10 000 views long form videos got 22 subscribers if a short got 10 000 views it was only going to get about 17 subscribers however something that might be important to note here is that on average it's probably going to take you a lot more time to create a long form video than a short so that's kind of something that you'll want to take into account looking at these numbers figure out how long it takes you to create a YouTube show on average how long it takes you to create a long-term video on average and use your own Common Sense assuming you want to do shorts that is as to like whether or not it's actually worthwhile you're doing that assuming your goal is to get subscribers and what about making money we've all seen those videos about how to make ten thousand dollars a day with YouTube shots and you actually go and post a YouTube shot for those of you who are monetized you'll probably have found that your YouTube shorts generate more like 10 cents per day but recently shorts were properly monetized by YouTube and what we can see here in Paddy's graphs are the before and after so before shorts were probably monetized they were earning on average per thousand views about 0.27 cents now however after monetization they only got 0.061 cents which is more than double the amount they were earning previously now it's still nowhere near that of a long form video which is pretty easy for a long form video to be you know between one to two dollars per thousand views in some niches it can be way higher than that but what we can see is that shorts are making more money than they once were chances are hopefully this number is going to continue to go up again look at these numbers how much YouTube shorts make on average per thousand views then look at on average how much long-form videos make per thousand views which again is different on every Niche but could like as a baseline you could look you know between one to two dollars per thousand views and again figure out how much time it takes you to create shorts and how many views your shorts get versus how much time it takes to create long form videos and how many views they get and then work out for yourself which ones are giving you the best test Roi the return on your time invested and you can see Paddy also expects that shorts will start making more money in the next few months but I highly doubt they will ever Challenge long-form videos but still again just work out your numbers so I hope this information was helpful for you again padding his team of Legends here for putting together this study so big thanks to him but if you want to

कुछ इस तरह के व्यूज आएंगे बट द क्वेश्चन इज कि आप अभी तक इस तरह के थंबनेल्स क्यों नहीं बना पा रहे क्योंकि आपको पता ही नहीं है कि प्रोफेशनल डिजाइनर्स किस मेथड का यूज़ करते हैं अपने थंबनेल बनाने के लिए उनकी साइकोलॉजी क्या होती है और उनको डिजाइनिंग की कौन-कौन सी चीजें पता है जो आपको नहीं पता इवन वो आईडिया सोचते कैसे हैं थंबनेल का इसकी भी आपको कोई नॉलेज नहीं है बट डोंट वरी इस वीडियो के बाद सब कुछ चेंज होने वाला है इस वीडियो मैं आपको थंबनेल डिजाइनिंग की प्रोसेस से लेके काफी सारे मेथड्स एंड ट्रिक्स बताने वाला हूं जो कि डिजाइनर्स यूज करते हैं और साथ ही वीडियो के एंड में आपको एक थंबनेल भी बना के दिखाने वाला हूं वो भी टोटली जीरो से तो अब ज्यादा टाइम खर्च किए बिना शुरू करते हैं डिजाइनिंग कांसेप्ट से लेकिन उससे भी पहले आपको पता होना चाहिए कि youtube2 यूनिक कैटेगरी में डिवाइड किया जा सकता है जो कुछ कोर एलिमेंट्स पे बेस्ड होते हैं ये एलिमेंट्स का यूज़ करके क्रिएटर्स अपने थंबनेल को इतना कैची बनाते हैं कि व्यूवर्स क्लिक किए बिना नहीं रह पाते चलिए एक-एक करके मैं आपको ये सारी कैटेगरी समझा देता हूं क्या आपने कभी सोचा है सेलर्स खुद को पायरेट से कैसे बचाते हैं या फिर यूएस का प्रेसिडेंट एक जगह से दूसरी जगह कैसे घूमता है अपनी गाड़ी को कन्वो वैन में डाल के या फिर एयरप्लेंस को कैसे टेस्ट किया जाता है मुर्गे की कुर्बानी देके यह सारे थंबनेल शॉकिंग है जो कि व्यूवर्स को एक सेकंड के लिए सोचने प मजबूर कर देते हैं और इतना क्यूरियस कर देते हैं कि वो अल्टीमेटली थंबनेल पे क्लिक कर देते हैं मिस्टर बीस के मैक्सिमम थंबनेल्स ऐसे ही होते हैं जितना बड़ा उतना अच्छा नंबर्स की बात कर रहा हूं एक 20 मिलियन डॉलर के ट में क्या होगा यह जानने का मन सबका होता है सेम वे में हर मिनट में $ कैसे कमाए यह जानने का मौका भी कोई नहीं छोड़ना चाहेगा इवन इमान गाज के मैक्सिमम थंबनेल्स इसी कांसेप्ट को फॉलो करते हैं इसलिए उसकी वीडियोस इतना चलती है लोगों को इतना ज्यादा एडिटेड और आर्टिफिशियल चीजें देखने की आदत हो गई है कि जब इस तरह के सिंपल थंबनेल देखते हैं तो उनका दिमाग इस चीज को प्रोसेस ही नहीं कर पाता एज अ रिजल्ट क्रिएटर्स को कुछ इस तरह के व्यूज मिल जाते हैं यानी कि आज के टाइम में आप कह सकते हैं सिंपलीसिटी गेट्स अटेंशन क्वेश्चन पूछो और आंसर बताए बिना भाग जाओ रियल लाइफ में ऐसा करोगे तो लोग आपके पीछे पड़ जाएंगे जवाब जानने के लिए और [संगीत] youtube0 में कोई बड़ा क्रिएटर दिखा दो काम बन जाएगा ठीक इसी थंबनेल स्ट्रेटेजी का यूज करके मैंने अपने चैनल को स्टार्ट किया था और मिस्टर बीज के नाम से तो जितने भी चैनल्स चल रहे हैं सब यही कर रहे हैं और ये चीज एक्चुअल में कितनी इ एक्टिव है ये खुद ही गेस कर लो दोनों में से कौन से थंबनेल पे क्लिक करोगे मेन कैरेक्टर को किसी बड़े ऑब्जेक्ट के अंदर रख दो या फिर पास में रख दो और व्यूज मिलियंस में ग्रंटेड है क्योंकि ऐसी चीजें हमें नॉर्मल अपनी लाइफ में देखने को नहीं मिलती है और अगर आपकी फीड में एकदम से कुछ ऐसा आ जाए तो बिना सोचे आप क्लिक जरूर करोगे ये वन ऑफ द मोस्ट कॉमन यूज थंबनेल डिजाइन है बेसिकली थंबनेल के टॉप पे एक टेक्स्ट लिख दो जो कि आपके टाइटल से लिंकड हो मेरी मैक्सिमम वीडियोस जिन्होंने अच्छा परफॉर्म किया है उनमें यही डि डिजाइन यूज़ किया गया है यह चीज आज से 5 साल पहले भी वर्क कर रही थी और आगे भी वर्क करती रहेगी कुछ भी कंपेयर कर दो चीप वर्सेस एक्सपेंसिव ए वर्सेस आओ जनवरी वर्सेस अप्रैल एंड सो ऑन और आपको व्यूज आते रहेंगे अब अगर आपको लग रहा है कि आपको थंबनेल्स की कैटेगरी पता चल गई है तो आप भी किसी एक कैटेगरी को फॉलो करके खुद के थंबनेल्स पे क्लिक ले आओगे तो आप गलत हो क्योंकि बड़े क्रिएटर्स ऐसा नहीं करते हैं उनको सारी थंबनेल्स कैटेगरी पता होती है और वो लोग इसे मर्ज करके अपने थंबनेल्स बनाते हैं जिसकी वजह से उनके व्यूज सीधा 10x हो जाते हैं मिस्टर बिस्टो इवन अपनी हर वीडियो के 10 थंबनेल्स बनवाते हैं और $100 से भी ज्यादा सिर्फ थंबनेल्स पे ही खर्च कर देते हैं क्योंकि वो हर एक स्टाइल को बनवा के देखते हैं लेकिन आपको इतनी मेहनत करने की जरूरत नहीं है अगर आपको डिजाइनिंग पर्सपेक्टिव समझ आ गया तो आपको बनाने से पहले ही पता होगा कि किस तरह का थंबनेल वर्क करने वाला है और फिर अब बस आपको उसे क्रिएट करना होगा नाउ डिजाइनिंग के अंदर मैं आपको बेसिक चीजें नहीं बताने वाला कि कंट्रास्टिंग कलर यूज़ करो थंबनेल को सिंपल रखो वर्ड्स कम इस्तेमाल करो ये सब ऑलरेडी आपको हर कोई दूसरा यूटर बता ही रहा होगा और बोल-बोल के आपका सर भी खा चुका होगा तो क्वेश्चन आता है कि डिजाइनिंग में हम लोग सीखने क्या वाले हैं कंपोजिशन का मतलब होता है कि आपके थंबनेल का ओवरऑल सेटअप कैसा होगा यानी कि कौन सा एलिमेंट कहां जाएगा और कैसे लगेगा वई लेआउट का मतलब होता है उन एलिमेंट्स को बैलेंस करना और स्पेसिफिक एलिमेंट्स की अरेंजमेंट करना ताकि कंपोजीशन ना बिगड़े नाउ इसके अंदर तीन-चार चीजें आती है जो कि मैं आपको सिखा देता हूं अगर आपको नहीं पता रूल ऑफ थर्ड क्या है तो मैं आपको बता दूं कि ये कांसेप्ट फोटोग्राफी में सबसे ज्यादा यूज किया जाता है इस रूल के अकॉर्डिंग आपको अपने कैनवस को थ बायथ के सेगमेंट में बांट देना है कुछ इस तरह से और जो भी आपका मेन एलिमेंट है या फिर पर्सन है या फिर फेस है उसे लाइन ऑफ इंटरसेक्शन पे रखना होता है ताकि फोटो के अंदर एक डेप्थस आए और एक फील आए आप किसी भी बड़े यूट्यू को देख लीजिए वो इसी रूल को अपने थंबनेल पे फॉलो कर रहा होगा तो मेक श्योर आप भी इस चीज का ध्यान रखें वरना आप भी कुछ इस तरह की गलतियां कर दोगे अब आपने कभी सोचा है कि थंबनेल्स में हमेशा फेस या पर्सन लेफ्ट साइड में क्यों होता है रीजन यह है कि हम थंबनेल्स को देखते नहीं है बल्कि आंखों से पढ़ते हैं और हमारी आंखों को लेफ्ट राइट पढ़ने की आदत होती है इसलिए आपको हमेशा अपने मेन एलिमेंट को लेफ्ट साइड में रखना है और सेकेंडरी एलिमेंट को राइट साइड में बेसिकली जो चीज आप चाहते हैं कि ऑडियंस पहले देखे उसे लेफ्ट साइड में रखना है थंबनेल के अंदर आपको मैक्स टू मैक्स तीन से चार एलिमेंट्स ही रखने हैं उससे ज्यादा नहीं जितने कम एलिमेंट्स होंगे उतना ही अच्छा मेरे मैक्सिमम थंबनेल्स जिन्होंने अच्छा वर्क किया है उनमें तीन एलिमेंट्स ही थे और मिस्टर बीज की मैक्सिमम वीडियोस में तो सिर्फ दो ही एलिमेंट्स होते हैं जिनमें से एक तो उसका खुद का फेस ही होता है मुझे एक डिजाइनर ने एक बात सिखाई थी जिसने मेरे थंबनेल को क्रिएट करने का पर्सपेक्टिव ही चेंज कर दिया अच्छा थंबनेल वो नहीं होता जिसमें ऐड करने के लिए कुछ ना बचा हो बल्कि वोह होता है जिसमें रिमूव करने के लिए कुछ ना बचा हो जिस तरह कोई भी ड्राइंग या आर्टवर्क को डायरेक्टली नहीं बनाया जाता है ठीक उसी वे में थंबनेल को भी डायरेक्टली नहीं बना सकते उसको लेयरिंग करके ही बनाना होता है यानी कि आपके पास एक फोरग्राउंड होगा मिड ग्राउंड होगा और एक बैकग्राउंड होना चाहिए और ये तीनों चीजें बैलेंस्ड होनी चाहिए आपस में भी और ओवरऑल थंबनेल में भी अब जिनको नहीं पता उनको बता दूं फोरग्राउंड वो चीज है जो सबसे सामने होगी बेसिकली हमारा मेन कैरेक्टर या फिर एलिमेंट मिड ग्राउंड वो चीज है जो बीच में होती है यानी कि सपोर्टिव टेक्स्ट या एलिमेंट एंड बैकग्राउंड तो बैकग्राउंड ही है इसको तो क्या ही एक्सप्लेन करूं इसके सिवाय लेआउटिंग में आपको थोड़ी और चीजें ध्यान में रखनी है जरूरी नहीं है कि आप हर बार मेन एलिमेंट को सेंटर में रखो बल्कि मेन चीजों को साइड में रख के आप सेकेंडरी एलिमेंट को शो कर सकते हो जिससे आपके थंबनेल में एक डायनेमिक फील आएगा नाउ कंपोजिटिंग एंड लेयरिंग के बाद आता है डिजाइनिंग का अगला कांसेप्ट जो कि है कलर्स अब आपको हर कोई ऑलरेडी बता चुका होगा कि कंप्लीमेंट्री कलर्स यूज करो ब्लैक के ऊपर वाइट रखो वाइट के ऊपर ब्लैक रखो कलर व्हील के अपोजिट कलर्स का इस्तेमाल करो रेड के साथ ग्रीन लो ब्लू के साथ ऑरेंज लो एंड सो ऑन बट द पॉइंट इज ये सारा काम हम कर क्यों रहे हैं कंट्रास्ट बनाने के लिए राइट नहीं ये आधी इंफॉर्मेशन है जो आपको पता है डिजाइनर्स कलर व्हील का यूज करते हैं सिर्फ कंट्रास्ट बनाने के लिए नहीं बल्कि एक कलर पैलेट बनाने के लिए जो कि वो लगभग अपने हर थंबनेल में यूज़ करते हैं लेकिन कलर पैलेट बनाते कैसे हैं वैसे तो कलर व्हील में आप इन छह पैटर्स को फॉलो करके एक कलर पैलेट बना सकते हो लेकिन अगर आपको इतनी कॉम्प्लेक्शन में नहीं जाना है तो मैं आपको एक इजी मेथड बता देता हूं जिससे आप खुद का एक कलर पैलेट बना सकते हैं सबसे पहले आप एक मेन कलर चूज कर लीजिए जो कि आपके चैनल को रिप्रेजेंट करने वाला है ये आपका फोरग्राउंड कलर होने वाला है एग्जांपल के लिए मैं यहां पे ब्लू चूज कर लेता हूं और इसके बाद आपको तीन कलर्स ऐड करने हैं ब्लैक ग्रे एंड वाइट क्योंकि ये कलर्स आपको कंट्रास्ट देंगे जो कि आपको चाहिए और हर थंबनेल में इन कलर्स की जरूरत तो पड़ने ही वाली है और आखिर में आपको अपना सेकेंडरी कलर चूज करना है जो कि कंप्लीमेंट्री होना चाहिए आपके मेन कलर का और ये चीज आप कलर व्हील में देख सकते हैं एंड बूम आपका कलर पैलेट तैयार है अब कलर्स के बाद आते हैं डिजाइन के अगले एलिमेंट पे जो कि है टाइपोग्राफी थंबनेल की टाइपोग्राफी में आपको ज्यादा कुछ समझने की जरूरत नहीं है सिवाय इसके कि आपको सेन शरिफ फ्ट्स का यूज करना है शेरिफ का नहीं शेरिफ फ्ट्स डिजाइंस के लिए यूज होते हैं यानी कि अगर आप मैगजीन बना रहे हो या कुछ लग्जरियस टाइप दिखा रहे हो तब आपको इसकी जरूरत पड़ेगी बट अगर आपको लोगों का ध्यान खींचना है आपको कुछ बोल्ड दिखाना चाहिए जो कि आसानी से पढ़ा जा सके वो भी जितना जल्दी हो सके उतना जल्दी तो इसके लिए सें शरिफ ही बेस्ट है जिस वर्ड को एमफसा इज करना है उसको बड़ा रखना और टेक्स्ट को उभारने के लिए स्ट्रोक या शैडो का यूज करना टाइपोग्राफी में आपको इससे ज्यादा कुछ भी सीखने की जरूरत नहीं है आपके लिए इतना ही इनफ है थंबनेल बनाने के लिए नाउ आपको थंबनेल्स की कैटेगरी पता है एंड थंबनेल्स बनाने के लिए आपको जितनी डिजाइनिंग आनी चाहिए थी उसकी भी पूरी थोरेट्स के आईडिया सोचने में तो वो कैसे करते हैं क्या हम यूटर्स के पास कोई स्पेशल ट्रिक है जिससे हम थंबनेल्स के आईडिया सोचते हैं नहीं बिल्कुल भी नहीं बल्कि हम सब बहुत ही बड़े चोर हैं हां आप लोगों ने बिल्कुल सही सुना हम सब एक दूसरे से चोरी करके अपने थंबनेल से आइडियाज लेते हैं यकीन नहीं हो रहा तो मिर बीस का ये थंबनेल देख लो जो कि इस थंबनेल से चुराया गया है रक का ये थ थंबनेल देख लो जो कि मिस्टर बीज से चुराया गया है या फिर मेरा ये थंबनेल देख लो जो कि एआई गाय ने चुराया या फिर ये वाला थंबनेल देख लो जो कि डिकोडिंग वाइटी से इंस्पायर्ड है लेकिन क्या ये एक्चुअल में चोरी है नहीं इसे इन्फ्लुएंस होना कहते हैं या फिर इंस्पायर होना बोलते हैं आर्ट की दुनिया में कोई भी चीज ओरिजिनल नहीं हो सकती हर चीज किसी ना किसी चीज से चुराई गई है या फिर मॉडिफाई की जाती है इस बात को अच्छे से समझने के लिए मैं आपको स्टील लाइक एन आर्टिस्ट बुक रेफर करूंगा बट द पॉइंट इज अगर हम दूसरे के थंबनेल से आईडिया ले भी रहे हैं तो उसे अपने आईडिया में कैसे बनाएं या फिर उसमें चीजें ऐड या रिमूव कैसे करें ताकि लोगों को ये ना लगे कि पूरा का पूरा कॉपी पेस्ट ही कर दिया है आंसर सिंपल है वही काम करो जो स्कूल में किया करते थे असाइनमेंट को पूरा करने के लिए और टीचर से बचने के लिए क्या स्कूल में आप सिर्फ एक ही बंदे से अपने टेस्ट या समर वेकेशन का काम कॉपी करते थे अगर हां तो आप गधे हो क्योंकि कॉपी हमेशा दो-तीन लोगों से करना चाहिए ताकि आसानी से पकड़े ना जाओ सेम वे में अगर थंबनेल का आईडिया चाहिए तो सिर्फ एक ही निश में ही क्यों घुस रहे हो बाकी निशस भी तो youtube0 है कि जिस तरह आपको पता है कि जो थंबनेल वर्क कर रहा है उसी को कॉपी करो उसी तरह आपके कंपीटीटर्स को भी ये चीज पता है एज अ रिजल्ट आप सब लोग लगभग सेम थंबनेल बना बैठोगे जिसकी वजह से ऑडियंस हो सकता है आपकी वीडियो ना देखे लेकिन अगर आप अपनी नीज से बाहर के आईडिया उठाते हो तो वो चीज हर एक के लिए अलग होने वाली है इवन अगर आपके कंपीटीटर को यह बात पता होगी तो भी ना के बराबर चांसेस है कि आप दोनों सेम निश में सेम थंबनेल से इंस्पायर हो जाओगे ऐसा नहीं होगा एज अ रिजल्ट वैरायटी बनी रहेगी तो दूसरी नीश से आईडिया कैसे लेते हैं और थंबनेल बनाते कैसे हैं और मेरा थंबनेल बनाने का क्या प्रोसीजर होता है अब मैं आपको ये सारी चीजें दिखाने वाला हूं वो भी प्रैक्टिकली और ये सब मैं आपको का नाम सुनके वीडियो बंद करने वाले अभी के अभी रुक जाओ अगर आपका सपना एक बड़ा यूबर बनना है तो आपको काम भी बड़े यूटर की तरह करना पड़ेगा और मैं किसी बड़े यूटर को नहीं जानता जो कि बैठ के कैनवा या पिक्सल्स में अपना थंबनेल बनाता है आपको प्रोफेशनली वर्क करना पड़ेगा और अगर आपने जिके बाद ओपन होते ही आपके सामने कुछ इस तरह का इंटरफेस आ जाएगा जहां नीचे के साइड आपको आपके प्रीवियस प्रोजेक्ट्स दिख जाएंगे अगर आपने नया-नया ही साइड में आपको काफी सारी डिटेल्स दी गई है जो कि आपको फिल करनी है जो डिटेल्स मैंने यहां पे फिल कर रखी है वही डिटेल्स आप अपने फाइल्स एडिट्स विंडोज एक्सेट एक्सट जो कि आपको एकल और वड जैसे प्रोग्राम्स में भी मिलती है उसके बाद लेफ्ट हैंड साइड में आपको आपका टूल बार दिया गया है जिसका यूज करके हम कुछ भी बना सकते हैं ठीक microsoft's दिए गए हैं तो सबसे पहले अगर आप कंट्रोल दबा के अपने माउस व्हील को स्क्रोल करते हो तो आप अपने कैनवास को लेफ्ट या राइट भेज सकते हो कुछ इस तरह से बेसिकली आप अपने वर्क स्पेस में मूव कर सकते हो वहीं ऑल्ट दबा के अगर आप स्क्रॉल करते हो तो आप वर्कस्पेस में ज़ूम इन या ज़ूम आउट कर सकते हो जितना चाहे उतना अब अगर आप नया-नया ही फोटोप सीख रहे हो और हो सकता है कि गलती से आपने अपने वर्कस्पेस को मैस अप कर दिया कुछ इस तरह से और चीजें इधर-उधर हो गई है तो आपको डरने की जरूरत नहीं है आपको बस टॉप में यहां जो विंडो लिखा गया है वहां पे जाना है और देन वर्कस्पेस में जाके रिसेट एसेंशियल्स पे क्लिक कर देना है जिसके बाद सारी चीजें अपनी ओरिजिनल पोजीशन पे चली जाएगी नाउ यहां लेयर्स में आप इस प्लस वाले आइकन पे क्लिक करके नए लेयर्स को ऐड कर सकते हैं और जिनको नहीं पता कि लेयर्स क्या होते हैं और ये कैसे काम करते हैं उनको मैं थोड़ा सा समझा देता हूं यहां टूल बार में आपको काफी सारे टूल्स दिए गए हैं जिनमें से सबसे पहला टूल जो मैं इस्तेमाल करूंगा वो है ब्रश टूल आप अपने ब्रश का साइज यहां से बढ़ा सकते हैं और उसकी हार्डनेस को भी कंट्रोल कर सकते हैं और यहां कलर पे क्लिक करके आप कोई भी रैंडम कलर चूज कर सकते हैं नाउ जब मैं कैनवास पे ब्रश रन करूंगा तो आप देख सकते हैं कि ये ब्रश मेरे लेयर वन पे चल रहा है बैकग्राउंड अभी भी बिल्कुल साफ है वहीं अगर मैं एक और लेयर ऐड कर दूं और फिर कलर चेंज करके दोबारा से ब्रश को चलाऊं तो यह ब्लू कलर रेड कलर के ऊपर आ जाएगा इसका रीजन यह है कि ब्लू कलर वाली लेयर रेड के ऊपर है अगर मैं रेड वाली लेयर को ब्लू के ऊपर रख दूंगा तो रेड कलर कैनवास में ऊपर आ जाएगा जैसा कि आप देख ही सकते हैं इस आई वाले बटन से आप अपनी लेयर्स को अपनी मर्ज के अकॉर्डिंग हाइड भी कर सकते हैं अब मैं आपको सारे इंपॉर्टेंट टूल्स बता देता हूं जिसका आप इस्तेमाल करने वाले हैं तो इसमें सबसे पहला है मूव टूल जिसको यूज़ करके आप अपने कैनवास में चीजों को मूव कर सकते हैं आपने जो भी लेयर सेलेक्ट की होगी उस लेयर के एलिमेंट्स मूव होने लग जाएंगे कुछ इस तरह से इवन मूव टूल का इस्तेमाल करके आप एलिमेंट्स की साइज को को बड़ा छोटा भी कर सकते हैं और अगर आपको दोनों लेयर्स को एक साथ मूव करना है तो आपको बस पहले किसी एक लेयर पे क्लिक करना है और फिर कंट्रोल दबा के दूसरी लेयर पे क्लिक करना है जिसके बाद दोनों लेयर्स सेलेक्ट हो जाएंगे एंड मूव टूल से आप इन दोनों को एक साथ ही मूव कर सकते हैं डजन मैटर यहां पे कितनी लेयर्स है जो जो आपने सेलेक्ट किया होगा वो सब कुछ मूव करेगा नाउ अगला टूल है सलेक्शन टूल अगर आप कैनवास पे कोई सलेक्शन बनाते हैं और फिर किसी लेयर को सेलेक्ट करते हैं जिसके बाद मूव टूल का इस्तेमाल करते हैं तो सिलेक्टेड पार्ट आपका मूव होने लग जाएगा बाकी चीजें नहीं होगी आप कंट्रोल प्स डी डबा के चीजों को डी सेलेक्ट कर सकते हैं अगला टूल है हमारे पास लासो टूल ये टूल भी सिलेक्शन का ही काम करता है लेकिन इसमें आपको काफी सारे सब टूल्स मिल जाते हैं जैसे कि मैग्नेटिक लासो टूल जिसे आप बिना ज्यादा मेहनत किए किसी भी कॉम्प्लेक्शन को सेलेक्ट कर सकते हैं आपको बस स्टार्टिंग में क्लिक करना है और फिर अपने माउस को शेप के आसपास घुमाना है और ये अपने आप ही सलेक्शन बनाता चला जाएगा शेप के अकॉर्डिंग लासो के नीचे आपको मैजिक वन टूल दिया गया है जो कि कलर के बेसिस पे सिलेक्शन बनाता है इवन आपको हर टूल के ट्यूटोरियल्स खुद एडो भी प्रोवाइड करता है आपको बस स्टार्ट करना है अब इसके बाद यहां पे जो भी इंपॉर्टेंट टूल है वो है इरेजर इरेजर का साइज आप अपने कीपैड में इस वाले बटन से भी बड़ा छोटा कर सकते हैं आपको डिलीट का बटन यहां मिल जाएगा जिससे आप डायरेक्टली लेयर्स को डिलीट कर सकते हैं अगर कोई इमेज कैनवास में इंपोर्ट करनी है तो बस उसे ड्रैग एंड ड्रॉप करो और वो खुद कैनवास पे आ जाएगी जिसे आपको यहां पे कंफर्म करना है और फिर इसको आप अपने मर्जी के अकॉर्डिंग चला सकते हो कंट्रोल t दबा के आप किसी भी चीज को छोटा बड़ा कर सकते हो लेकिन ये एक सिमेट्री वे में होगा यानी कि हर जगह से वो इक्वली इफेक्ट होगा लेकिन अगर आप कुछ ऐसा करना चाहते हो तो आपको शिफ्ट दबा के कोई भी एक कोना पकड़ लेना है और फिर उसको स्ट्रेच कर देना है और आपका काम हो जाएगा अगर गलती से कोई गलती हो जाती है तो आप कंट्रोल z दबा के उसे अनडू भी कर सकते हो नाउ आई होप आपको तो इसके लिए सबसे पहले मैं आने पे मुझे एक और थंबनेल मिला जो कि छोटे चैनल पे भी वर्क कर चुका है तो इसे भी मैं सेव कर लूंगा इसके बाद मुझे एक और थंबनेल मिला जो कि थंबनेल से रिलेटेड टॉपिक पे तो नहीं था लेकिन उसमें एक सेंटेंस काफी क्लिकब्रिक्स करने का पोटेंशियल रखता है अब मुझे काफी सारे सिमिलर थंबनेल्स दिख रहे थे तो मैं सर्च बार में जाके टाइटल को थोड़ा चेंज कर दूं गा और दोबारा से स्क्रॉल करना स्टार्ट कर दूंगा नीचे आते टाइम मुझे एक थंबनेल मिला जिसका कांसेप्ट तो अच्छा था और इसे मैं और भी ज्यादा बेहतर बना सकता हूं नाउ मैंने अपनी नीश रिलेटेड तो काफी थंबनेल्स उठा लिए लेकिन ये इनफ नहीं है इसलिए अब मैं दूसरी नीश के थंबनेल्स भी देखूंगा मैं पर्सनली जिस नीश को देखता हूं वो है सेल्फ इंप्रूवमेंट नीश क्योंकि इनकी ऑडियंस लगभग 13 साल से 18 साल की होती है नाउ यहां पे स्क्रॉल करते हुए मुझे हमजा का एक थंबनेल मिलता है जिसे मैं अपने थंबनेल के लिए अडेप्ट करवा सकता हूं तो इसे भी मैं यहां से डाउनलोड कर लूंगा और फिर कुछ रैंडम क्रिएटर्स के थंबनेल देखूंगा फॉर एग्जांपल इमान गाजी इसके चैनल पे दूसरा ये थंबनेल मुझे काफी अच्छा लगा और मैं इमेजिन कर सकता हूं कि ये आईडिया मेरे थंबनेल के लिए कैसे यूज़फुल है तो मैं इसे भी डाउनलोड कर लूंगा नाउ मैंने काफी सारे थंबनेल्स डाउनलोड कर लिया है ईया के लिए अब मैं करूंगा क्या कि मैं थंबनेल बनाने वाला हूं जो कि इनसे अलग भी होगा लेकिन इनसे इंस्पायर्ड भी होगा नाउ यहां पे सारी बात क्रिएटिव माइंडसेट की आ जाती है मैंने इन थंबनेल्स को डाउनलोड किया है क्योंकि मैं इमेजिन कर सकता हूं कि हर एक थंबनेल को मैं कैसे मॉडिफाई करके अपने लिए नया थंबनेल बना सकता हूं लेकिन वो चीज हो सकता है आपको नहीं दिख रही होगी इसलिए मैं यहां पे एग्जांपल के लिए आपको थोड़ा सा ट्राई करता हूं समझाने का कि मेरे दिमाग में क्या चल रहा है मैं एक youtube1 पे ले आता हूं और आपको अपनी इमेजिनेशन दिखाने की कोशिश करता हूं अगर मैं यहां इमान गाज की जगह अपने youtube2 करके तो भी एक एक अच्छा खासा थंबनेल बन जाएगा या फिर यहां पे अगर मैं आइक की शक्ल की जगह अपना youtube2 के साथ तो वो भी काफी अच्छा थंबनेल दे देगा लेकिन वो चीज कहीं ना कहीं कॉपीडब्ल्यूबी जो कि मेरे थंबनेल के लिए होने वाली है अब पर्सनली मुझे ये टाइटल और कांसेप्ट ज्यादा अच्छा लगा तो मैं इसे ही रीक्रिएट करने की कोशिश करूंगा लेकिन मैं अपने थंबनेल में इतना ज्यादा एमटी स्पेस नहीं छोड़ने वाला तो मैं करूंगा क्या कि सबसे पहले मैं बैकग्राउंड तैयार करूंगा तो मैं अपने यहां टूलबार में जाके सबसे पहले शेप टूल में जाऊंगा जहां पे मैं रेक्टेंगल को चूज करूंगा और फिर यहां ऊपर फिल्म में जाके डिसाइड करूंगा कि रेक्टेंगल के अंदर कौन सा कलर होना चाहिए मैं अपने थंबनेल्स में मेनली ब्लू कलर यूज करता हूं तो मैं यहां पे भी ब्लू ही देख रहा हूं लेकिन एक नॉर्मल कलर लेने की जगह यहां पे ग्रेडिएंट ज्यादा अच्छा लगेगा जो कि आप यहां से देख सकते हैं यहां पे आपको डिफरेंट डिफरेंट कलर के काफी सारे ग्रेडिएंट पैटर्स मिल जाएंगे तो मैं ब्लू में जाके एक डार्क ब्लू टाइप ग्रेडिएंट ले लूंगा और फिर एक रेक्टेंगल बनाऊंगा जो कि थंबनेल जैसा दिखाई देगा आप देख सकते हैं कि रेक्टेंगल बनते ही इसके अंदर कलर अपने आप फिल हो गया अब अगर आप ध्यान दें तो मेरे रेक्टेंगल के कॉर्नर्स कर्व्ड है स्ट्रेट नहीं है तो ये काम आप रेक्टेंगल को चूज करके यहां से पिंच करके कर सकते हैं जितना ज्यादा पिंच करोगे उतना ज्यादा कर्वी होगा ये चीज को आप यहां से भी कंट्रोल कर सकते हैं वैसे नाउ मैं इन कॉलम्स को जो कि इस लड़की ने यूज़ किया है इससे अपना पूरा बैकग्राउंड बनाने वाला हूं और फिर एक यूनिक थंबनेल बाहर निका लूंगा तो अभी के लिए इस रेक्टेंगल से मैं लेफ्ट साइड की रो बनाता हूं तो इस रेक्टेंगल को मैं कंट्रोल ् c और फिर कंट्रोल प् v दबा के कॉपी क पेस्ट कर लूंगा और अलाइन कर लूंगा नाउ मैंने दोनों लेयर्स को सेलेक्ट करके कॉपी पेस्ट करूंगा ताकि काम आसान हो जाए और ऐसा करते रहूंगा जब तक नीचे तक ना पहुंच जाऊं नाउ आप यहां पे आप देख सकते हैं कि मैंने पूरी एक रो बना ली है रेक्टेंगल से लेकिन ये थोड़ा सा ज्यादा लग रहा है और मेरे थंबनेल को मैस कर सकता है तो मैं नीचे के दो रेक्टेंगल को डिलीट करके बचे हुए रेक्टेंगल का साइज बढ़ा दूंगा कुछ इस तरह से और फिर इस पूरी रो को कॉपी पेस्ट करके मैं ऐसे ही रोज बनाता जाऊंगा जब तक मेरा कैनवास कवर ना हो जाए नाउ आप यहां पे देख सकते हैं कि ये करते-करते मैंने यहां पे कितनी सारी लेयर्स क्रिएट कर ली है इवन मुझे अपना लेयर वाला पैनल पूरा दिख भी नहीं रहा है मुझे यहां स्क्रोल करना पड़ रहा है तो मैं करूंगा क्या कि ऊपर वाले पैनल को थोड़ा सा छोटा कर लूंगा ताकि मुझे सारी लेयर्स दिखाई दे और अगर ये काफी नहीं है तो मैं यहां से इस पैनल को थोड़ा सा डिलीट भी कर लूंगा अब ये सब करने के बाद भी मुझे यहां पे काफी सारी लेयर्स दिख रही है तो मैं क्या करूंगा कि इनका एक फोल्डर बना लूंगा आपको बस एक रो के सभी रेक्टेंगल को यहां लेयर्स में सेलेक्ट कर लेना है और फिर यहां पे क्लिक कर देना है जिसके बाद वो सभी लेयर्स इकट्ठा होके एक फोल्डर में चले जाएंगे और इस फोल्डर का आप अपने अकॉर्डिंग नामकरण कर सकते हैं ठीक ऐसा ही मैं सभी रोस के साथ करूंगा जिसके बाद मेरे पास यहां पे इनफ स्पेस होगी और मैं सभी लेयर्स को एक साथ देख पाऊंगा अब यहां पे जो हमारा बैकग्राउंड है वो वाइट है और वो अच्छा नहीं लग रहा है तो इसके लिए मैं पहले इस लेयर को अनलॉक करूंगा और यहां से फोरग्राउंड यानी कि टॉप का कलर ब्लैक रख दूंगा जिसके बाद मैं शिफ्ट प्लस बैक स्पेस दबा आंगा तो सामने कुछ ऐसा पॉपअप आ जाएगा और ओके दबाने पे ब्लैक कलर पूरे कैनवास पे फिल हो जाएगा ये चीज आप यहां पे देख सकते हैं ना मुझे ये टेक्स्ट चाहिए तो मैं यहां टेक्स्ट टूल को सेलेक्ट करने के बाद टेक्स्ट लिख दूंगा और पूरे टेक्स्ट को सेलेक्ट करके यहां से इसका कलर चेंज कर लूंगा डबल क्लिक करने के बाद आप यहां से फॉन्ट भी चेंज कर सकते हैं इस थंबनेल में सें सफ से ज्यादा सरी फंट अच्छा लग रहा है तो मैं उसे ही यूज़ करूंगा और टेक्स्ट को अलाइन कर दूंगा अपने कैनवास से अब मुझे एक टिक वाला पीएनजी चाहिए तो वो मैं पीएनजी विंग की वेबसाइट पे जाके डाउनलोड कर लूंगा और अपने कैनवास में इंपोर्ट कर लूंगा और उसके साइज को सेट कर दूंगा टेक्स्ट के अकॉर्डिंग नाउ यहां पे मेरे पास अपना टाइटल भी है यहां पे पीएनजी भी है लेकिन ये स्टिल ऊपर वाले पूरे एरिया को कवर नहीं कर रहा है तो मैं इसे थोड़ा सा बड़ा कर लूंगा ताकि ये इजली विजिबल रहे अब ये जो हमारा बैकग्राउंड है ये काफी ज्यादा ब्राइट है और बैकग्राउंड डल होना चाहिए ताकि मेन एलिमेंट ज्यादा इजली देखा जा सके तो मैं सभी ग्रुप्स को सेलेक्ट करूंगा और यहां से उनकी ओपेसिटी को थोड़ा सा कम कर दूंगा अब किसी ग्लिच की वजह से मेरा ये लेफ्ट वाला कॉलम सेलेक्ट नहीं हुआ है तो मैं लेफ्ट वाले कॉलम के ग्रुप पे क्लिक करूंगा और उसके अंदर के सभी लेयर्स को सेलेक्ट करके उनका एक साथ यहां से ओपेसिटी कम कर दूंगा अब मुझे यहां से दिख रहा है कि टेक्स्ट की लाइन में थोड़ी सी गड़बड़ है तो मैं दोनों को एक साथ सेलेक्ट करके उन्हें भी ठीक कर लूंगा अब जिस तरह हमारे रेफरेंस में एक थंबनेल अलग कलर का दिखाया गया है हमें भी वही करना है तो इसके लिए मैं एक न्यू लेयर बनाऊंगा और दोबारा से रेक्टेंगल शेप को चूज कर लूंगा अब आप ये देखिए कि आपका सेकेंडरी कलर जो आपने चूज किया है वो मेरे कैनवास में डार्क ब्लू है तो मैं सके कि कौन सा कलर इसके साथ बेस्ट कॉम्प्लीयंट पे आके रेक्टेंगल के अंदर रेड ग्रेडिएंट फिल कर दूंगा और इस बार एक बड़ा सा रेक्टेंगल बनाऊंगा नाउ मुझे इस रेक्टेंगल को सेंटर में अलाइन करने में दिक्कत आ रही है तो मैं कंट्रोल r दबा के अपने वर्कस्पेस में रोलर्स को ले आऊंगा और ड्रैग करके इससे सेंटर में एक लाइन बना लूंगा जिसके बाद मैं अपने रेक्टेंगल को यहां पे परफेक्टली फिट कर लूंगा अब ये परफेक्ट जगह बैठ तो गया है लेकिन इसका कलर हल्का सा पिंकिश है और मुझे रेड या ऑरेंज चाहिए तो मैं यहां पे इसे चेंज कर लूंगा और आप देख सकते हैं कि अब कितना अच्छा कंट्रास्ट बन चुका है और हमें यही तो करना था एक अच्छा कंट्रास्ट बनाना था नाउ मेरे पास यहां पे काफी सारी खाली स्पेस है तो मैं यहां पे एक हैंड पीएनजी लगा दूंगा और उसे भी पीएनजी विंग से ही डाउनलोड करूंगा नाउ ये थंबनेल पहले से तो अच्छा लग रहा है लेकिन इसमें अभी भी काफी ज्यादा खाली स्पेस है तो यहां पे भी मैं कुछ भरना चाहता हूं हमारे रेफरेंस में यहां पे पूरा एक लोगो और टाइटल का स्पेस था तो हम भी उसी चीज को यहां पे क्रिएट कर देते हैं लेकिन इस बार हमें कलर को ग्रे रखना पड़ेगा तो मैं पहले शेप में जाके सर्कल ले लेता हूं और सर्कल बना देता हूं अब कलर ढूंढने में मुझे दिक्कत आ रही थी तो मैं काम हो जाएगा अब जब मैंने सर्कल और रेक्टेंगल दोनों बना लिया तो मुझे सर्कल की वजह से अपना डिजाइन थोड़ा सा खराब लग रहा था तो उस चीज को मैं यहां से डिलीट कर दूंगा और बचे हुए पूरे स्पेस को रेक्टेंगल से ही फिल कर लूंगा नाउ ये मुझे ज्यादा बेटर लग रहा है और अपने थंबनेल के अंदर थोड़ा सा ज्यादा स्टोरी टेलिंग करने के लिए मैं यहां पे व्यूज भी लिख देता हूं ताकि हमारा काम अच्छे से बन जाए इस वाले टेक्स्ट का फॉन्ट मैं ट्राई करूंगा कि youtube0 हो तो मैं यहां पे अलग-अलग टेक्स्ट के साथ ट्राई करके एट द एंड मैंने ये टेक्स्ट चूज कर लिया है नाउ कहने के लिए तो हमारा थंबनेल रेडी है और सारे बिगिनर्स इस थंबनेल को बिना सोचे समझे अपलोड भी कर देंगे लेकिन एज अ प्रोफेशनल थंबनेल डिजाइनर आप एक चीज भूल रहे हैं वो है शैडोज शैडोज ही थंबनेल में असली जान डालती है क्योंकि वो थंबनेल्स में डेप्थस देती है तो शैडो बनाना कोई मुश्किल काम नहीं है आपको बस ब्रश टूल को सेलेक्ट करना है और ब्लैक कलर चूज करके अपने ब्रश का साइज थोड़ा सा बढ़ा लेना है जिसके बाद आपको यहां से अपने फ्लो और ओपेसिटी को दोनों को कम कर लेना है और यहां से हार्डनेस को भी थोड़ा सा कम कर लेना है ताकि शैडो को कंट्रोल कर सको अब शैडो कौन-कौन सी जगह लगेगी सबसे पहले तो हमारे टेक्स्ट के नीचे तो आपको टेक्स्ट वाली लेयर के नीचे ही एक लेयर ऐड कर लेनी है और फिर हल्का-हल्का वहां पे ब्रश रन करना है जिससे कि आपका टेक्स्ट काफी अच्छे से उभर के बाहर आ जाएगा अब क्योंकि मुझे दिखाना है कि ये वाला जो रेक्टेंगल है ये बाहर आया है पुराने रेक्टेंगल से तो इसमें भी मुझे शैडो ऐड करनी पड़ेगी तो मैं बड़े वाले रेक्टेंगल के लेयर पे जाऊंगा और उसके नीचे एक और लेयर ऐड कर लूंगा और उसके बाद वहां पे भी ब्रश को रन करूंगा लेकिन उसके साइज को थोड़ा सा छोटा करके सेम काम आपको हाथों के नीचे भी करना पड़ेगा डिटेलिंग देने के लिए और आपका थंबनेल अब रेडी है लेकिन एक्सपो सेटिंग में हो सकता है कि आप जब ये थंबनेल अपलोड करो तो आपके थंबनेल के पिक्सेल फट जाए और मुझसे हमेशा पूछा जाता है कि मैं ऐसा क्या करता हूं जो मेरे थंबनेल्स इतने क्रिस्पी होते हैं इतने ज्यादा अच्छे टेक्सचर के साथ होते हैं तो आज मैं आपको वो सीक्रेट भी बता देता हूं आपको चार बटंस एक साथ दबाने हैं कंट्रोल शिफ्ट ऑल्ट और e जिसके बाद आपके पास एक न्यू लेयर होगी जिसमें आपके पूरा डिजाइन होगा इसको सेलेक्ट करने के बाद आपको फिल्टर में जाना है और कैमरा रव फिल्टर चूज करना है जिसके बाद आपके पास आपके थंबनेल के कंट्रास्ट सैचुरेशन टेक्सचर जैसी चीजों को कंट्रोल करने का ऑप्शन मिल जाएगा आपको यहां पे मेक श्यर करना है कि आप टेक्सचर को थोड़ा सा बढ़ा दो और अपने थंबनेल में थोड़ा से ग्रेन दे दो बहुत ही थोड़े से और बाकी चीजें जो जो आपको आपके थंबनेल के अकॉर्डिंग अच्छी लग रही है उसको उस तरह से आप ड्रैग कर सकते हो नाउ ओके पे क्लिक करने के बाद मेरा पूरा थंबनेल तैयार है और इसे अब मुझे बस एक्सपोर्ट करना है तो एक्सपोर्ट करने के लिए आपको फाइल में जाना है और एक्सपोर्ट पे क्लिक करना है जिसके बाद आपको एक्सपोर्ट एज पे क्लिक करना है और जेपीजे फॉर्मेट चूज करके क्वालिटी को फुल कर देना है और ध्यान रखना है कि यहां पे थंबनेल का साइज 2mb से कम ही हो एंड आपका काम हो गया है आप इवन थंबनेल prev.com पे जाके चेक भी कर सकते हो कि आपका थंबनेल अलग-अलग डिवाइस पे कैसा दिखेगा तो ये होता है प्रोसीजर एक थंबनेल बनाने का लेकिन क्या पहली बारी में इतना अच्छा थंबनेल बन जाता है नहीं डिजाइन बनाते बनाते समझ आता है कि आप क्या बना रहे हो फॉर एग्जांपल जो थंबनेल मैंने आपको अभी बना के दिखाया सेम थंबनेल को बनाने के लिए हमने इन डिजाइन से होते हुए गए थे ना नाउ आई नो आप में से काफी सारे लोग सोच रहे होंगे कि थंबनेल बनाना मुश्किल है लेकिन ऐसा नहीं है आपको अगर एडवांस लेवल की एडिटिंग नहीं आती है तो आप थंबनेल टेंपलेट्स भी बाय कर सकते हो जो आपको पहले से ही काफी सारे यूनिक डिजाइंस देता है और उसे आप अपने अकॉर्डिंग चेंज या मोल्ड भी कर सकते हो दिवेश ने एक ऐसा ही टेंप्लेट का बंडल बना रखा है जिसमें काफी सारी निशस के थंबनेल डिजाइंस है और साथ ही मेरे भी काफी सारे थंबनेल्स के टेंप्लेट है तो आप उसकी वेबसाइट प जाक वो बाय कर सकते हैं लिंक मैंने डिस्क्रिप्शन में दे दिया है लेकिन अगर आप मेहनत करने के लिए तैयार हैं तो आप देवेश के चैनल पे जरूर विजिट करना क्योंकि उसने मेरे काफी सारे थंबनेल्स को ब्रेक डाउन किया है और वो काफी ज्यादा डिटेल में इवन उसने

====== Estudo_Especialista_108_Meet the Man Who Solved YouTube (Paddy Galloway Interview) ====== 
I can make any Niche viral literally any Niche viral that's Patty Galloway the most prolific YouTube strategist in the world and he is here today to address the most common problem hurting smaller channels oh I can't do this because my Niche isn't like that or my Niche is limited because I think so often creators use that as an excuse over the past decade Patty has worked with thousands of channels and generated over 10 billion views and in this video he's going to walk you through the strategy he used to do it including pre-production I was like to say there's three main sources of ideas internal ideas external ideas and then packaging at 20% better title could mean double triple quadruple it could mean a 100 times more views and some hot takes there is no meta thank you to one of 10 for sponsoring this video some of the most common comments we get from people especially when we have videos about how to find more success on YouTube is people will say things like that great but that won't work for my Niche or yeah but I'm operating in this really small audience or that would never work for me so my first question to you is are there niches that are just destined to fail like are there niches that are just too small to make work on YouTube this is honestly one of my biggest uh pet peeves as a strategist as someone that works with so many different channels is people just associate me with you know the biggest creators I've work with um and I sometimes feel like like saying hey like I've worked with hundreds of channels I'm not just like a beast boy I'm not just like a Mr Beast disciple just because I might have worked with him at some point in the past I've worked with channels in so many different niches and I have yet to find a single Niche where I can't get some traction now that traction might look different for different niches you know some niches are naturally smaller I always like to use this term which you know and you've you've heard me talk about before Tam totally addressable Market I like to think about that for YouTube channels and think like how big is the market for something but every time someone has come to me and said hey you know my Niche is too small it's all well and good you talking about all this stuff I don't have all this money my Niche is small I don't have this and that I look at their Niche and it's like a golf Niche I'm like 30 million people play golf every weekend or something like you know there's a there's a lot of viewership in the golf Niche there's there's plenty of room there or it's something like knitting and you know again like go go search knitting on YouTube and filter by most viewed you'll see knitting videos with millions of views so I have yet to sort of find a niche that I don't think has a big enough audience of course there's going to be like some exceptions some examples of things which are just so so hyper Niche that there's only a few thousand people in the world that care about it and in which case maybe in that situation you should look at trying a different Niche but um I really I really hate that um that Viewpoint of oh I can't do this because my Niche isn't like that or my Niche is limited because I think so often creators use that as an excuse to to not actually try harder with their content and not to put the onus on themselves to make great content instead just blaming the market they're operating within it feels like a very disempowering belief like why would you want to believe that there's a low ceiling on what you're trying to do I feel like you should be doing everything in your power to blow that ceiling off what you think you can do so when you think about the The Tam the total addressable Market how do you actually go about identifying or calculating what you think the Tam for a channel might be yeah I love I love thinking about it like that as like a limiting belief because my team will sort of testify this I've you know built a small team around myself over the the last few years and something I always say is like the mindset you have towards content and like the the sort of philosophy you have towards content has a huge impact in what you actually go on to do so like one thing my team will always hear me say is we can make literally any n viral like I can make any Niche viral just give me the topics give me the tools give me the right sort of Direction and I can make that Niche viral and um I think even just like this idea like you talked about of or like we've talked about of Tam like how do you calculate that sometimes people think about things there's a fancy name for it Tam they over complicate it to me it's just about saying well what's our Niche let's just say our Niche is golf let's go to YouTube search golf in YouTube and then in the search filters that you can apply on YouTube this isn't using some like weird paid tool just on YouTube search that term golf um filter it for longer videos so just filter out short so you can actually filter video length in the search filters on YouTube and just then sort by most viewed and what you'll see is for golf you'll see like probably all these huge outliers at the top where there's like some random like you know I know the side men make a golf video that has 34 4 million views that's probably not an accurate representation of how many views there could be for the golf Niche but if you go down a little bit further you see okay here's this Golf Channel that does tutorials there's many videos they have that have a million views here's just so the Golf Channel that does entertainment videos he has like one and two million view videos and before you know you're getting a picture of okay at the very high level the best channels in the space get this viewership that's probably a pretty accurate picture of roughly where your time could be now of course there's some niches that aren't capitalized yet there's some niches that haven't been fully explored and discovered and conquered by creators so there is like more viewership in some of those niches but time to me is just really just seeing what are the best in the niche currently doing views wise like what are they hitting and what am I hitting so before blaming the niche I could look at that and say well if I'm a Golf Channel that's doing like 100,000 views a video which is still great but I'm like my Niche is too small I need to change I need to Pivot well if the best channels are doing a million views of video I'm still like 10% of what I could be doing 10% which is kind of crazy when you think about it and a lot of people that come to me with these things of saying I'm in too small of a niche they the real reality is they're probably a Golf Channel doing 10,000 views a video or 5,000 views a video so that's just generally how I think about it just like looking at what the biggest channels are doing and using that as a bit of a benchmark for what is possible in the niche do you have any examples of channels that they started off narrower than they needed to be and you decided hey let's actually expand the way were thinking about this to have a larger total addressable Market yeah someone someone I do think is a great example of it and it's someone I'm sure you're familiar with is Noah Kagan so when I first started doing some work with Noah Kagan I believe that was 2020 or 2021 and I could just see he was like a really talented entrepreneur he had lots of interesting stories but he was doing like very very Niche things when I thought there was more potential there I thought like he had built a lot of the foundation of what a great YouTube channel needs to be so he had he built a team he had good editing he had like decent thumbnails but the topics he was picking was like you know six tools that help me run my business or how to use slack or how to like which Zoom Zoom versus like Google meets like like these sort of like very Niche business topics um and I went in and I was like what if we just go for bigger swings we go for bigger videos we go for things like you know asking millionaires for advice and you know that's obviously such a huge Trend now but we were doing that like two or three years ago um going going for like really General business videos that we could say to ourselves someone at the very beginning of their Journey who doesn't know what slack even is because they don't even need to think about slack yet because they're just by themselves they can watch this video and enjoy it and then also someone that's a more seasoned entrepreneur can still watch and enjoy it because they'll still find interest in the things we're covering in the video and actually just even going back to this idea of like niches being too limited or like my Niche is boring like even when I was thinking before this podcast I was just some names just came to mind like someone that was actually in the last cohort of uh my accelerator program which is you know this group coaching program I run his name was Andrew millison have a guess what his Niche is like it's the most it's it like the actual Niche itself is so Niche but he gets so much viewership like try to think of the most random Niche you can think of oh my gosh okay I'm going to guess that he does um Eastern dance Trends it's a great guess great guess that is pretty neat and actually sounds like probably quite good viewership in that I might I might look into that right after this the podcast so his Niche is horiculture and more specifically permaculture which I believe hopefully no one calls me out on this in the comments but I believe it's just like a a strain of horticulture that focuses more on like permanently like building out sustainable horiculture like you know resources uh plants Farms you know uh Water Systems this is what he focuses on on his channel that's like his background and if I was to tell you okay he's he nich is horiculture he's like a lecturer in horiculture um what do you think like his most huged recent video got well to answer that it's 12 million views wow got 12 million views on a video during our last cohort the video was how the UN is holding back the Sahara Desert and that has 12 million views in four months um and across his channel you're just seeing you know 1.5 million 1.6 million he's got multiple videos that are a million plus when he started his channel he was focusing much more on kind of a bit more Niche topics around like water harvesting uh rehydrating the concrete jungle like maybe show these videos on screen as we're talking about it a lot of these are much more kind of Niche and then he realized that wow even though this is like a small potentially boring Niche I can make really broad topics so that 12 million view video how the UN is holding back the Sahara Desert it's got a really interesting fil I love like the the left and right contrast in the fil the title itself how the UN so the UN is a very well-known thing you know the United Nations super wellknown everyone knows about it like really top of mind holding back the Sahara Desert like just that framing of holding back I love that that term holding back the Sahara Desert he is managed to build his niche of permaculture um and gardening basically into a topic that's relevant to 12 million plus people and I think that's like you know this is kind of what it's all about right when you when you think about how easy it would be for him to say oh I can never get views in this Niche because no one cares about permaculture or like you know there's not enough interesting topics I can't make the average person care about it well he made 12 million people care about a video about you know the Sahara Desert and permac culture in the Sahara Desert so it's a great example of just thinking beyond your Niche and kind of playing into some of the the key principles I think about when it comes to building out um big viewership in a smaller Niche and there are tools that can help you do that like today's sponsor one of 10 one of 10 is a tool specifically made to help YouTubers find better ideas using outlier videos here's how let's go over to the filters Tab and set the parameters for our search we'll set the multiplier to a 3X minimum meaning it will only show us videos that had three times the views relative to the average of that Channel's last five videos and we want these videos to have at least 100,000 views and were posted in the last year now we want to dig in and get really specific because we're thinking beyond our Niche here Let's Pretend We're uh a productivity Channel looking for our next big idea I'm going to search toys cuz why not we'll see where to go from here I tested illegal kids toys this is actually really interesting if you hover over that thumbnail you'll see that you can Dive Right into similar topics or thumbnails let's click topics oh look at this I tested 100 Years of kids toys what if we could do I tested 100 Years of productivity hacks or maybe I tested 100 Years of morning routines you know I could throw some history into the next video and make it really interesting knowing where to start and getting your creative juices flowing can feel like a really big task but with one of 10 it's really that easy to get your brainstorming process started you can try one of tent for one month for only $1 using the code Creator thank you to one of 10 for sponsoring this video if I'm thinking visually it kind of sounds like what you're suggesting is if you think about your Niche it's probably a subin interest of some number of cascading larger interests so it seems like the advice you're giving is to go upstream or a little bit more broad above that category to figure out what is the broadest or one of the broadest categories this sits with in and let's make videos that address that audience am I getting that correct absolutely absolutely like when I'm thinking about what are the um what are the traits of a viral video within an Niche the first thing on that list of traits that I look at is what I call CCN core casual new I'm looking for videos that hit our core so if we think about like our Niche like within our Niche there's like the really core viewers who like really care about the thing the second C stands for casual so core casual so are we hitting the more casual viewers that kind of dip in and dip out of this Niche and like care a little bit about it but they're maybe not as like hardcore viewers and are we hitting the new viewers so those are viewers that maybe aren't into the niche they haven't watched our channel before but there are people that just if they see something interesting they might click the video so just like how let's just say we talk about permaculture horiculture maybe I don't care about that maybe I'm not into it but if I see that video about how they un is holding back the Sahara Desert it's packaged in a way that can attract me as a new viewer it probably also attracts the core viewers who really care about that topic too and it attracts the casuals who kind of dip in and dip out the best way to look at your Niche and expand your Niche is look at every idea and say can a core casual and new viewer all click this video and enjoy it and I think that's where so many people go wrong they get too caught up in just the core they get too caught up in just like appeasing like the hardcore horiculture you know students and viewers who want to see these really technical things and they forget about the casual and the new viewer and then on the flip side some people get too caught up in the new viewer and they just forget to like also appeal to that core and they go too broad and they kind of miss miss the mark with the audience that they have been building so I really really like to think of that like that's that framework it sounds simple and I think I've mentioned it in tweets and things before but I cannot mention it enough because that just changes how you approach YouTube you look at every niche as like you said said a kind of expanding Niche and not like a limiting Niche so if I'm reading between the lines here a little bit it sounds like what you're saying is if I'm trying to grow my channel that means that I'm by definition trying to attract new viewers and the best way to attract new viewers is to make a video that has broader appeal so that it has a better chance of getting a click when it's in a recommended area to a stranger exactly exactly like broad broadening the peel of your niche is so crucial and I think there's this thing you know curse of knowledge bias where when we know something we assume everyone else knows it and what that means is sometimes as as you know creators in niches we can end up always trying to go like really specific and narrow to try to like show viewers new things but sometimes we just forget that like oh actually the more simple things the more simple ways of framing things like that might seem obvious to us but maybe that expands the reach of the video maybe it makes it more interesting to you know broader group of people so yeah I'm always looking at it and saying like how can we just make sure that we're not just limiting it to the horee viewers and often if you're if you're hardcore enough of a niche of a fan of a niche to make a YouTube channel around it you're going to want to go really Niche and specific but that's in itself a trap because then you end up just appealing to other people that are just as hardcore about the niche as you are and that's probably a very small percentage of viewers is there a risk here of making something that is so broadly appealing that it goes well and suddenly our audience isn't targeted for what we're actually trying to do anymore yeah I think I think I always find that point kind of interesting because there definitely is something to it but from my point of view like I would describe myself as like a view maximizer you know and I am very like open about that like I go into channels and I try to maximize views I try to take channels from a million views a month to 10 million views a month to 100 million views a month there are so many other objectives we have as creators sometimes that objective might be hey we actually have a niche product that is actually more focused on the more hardcore you know really focused viewers in this Niche so expanding out broad doesn't actually do much for our bigger business um and in that case it's okay to just like Focus down on that more specific viewer but if our goal is to grow viewership then I don't think we should ever be afraid of trying to expand that out so long as we're not just like you know doing absolutely random stuff just in you know in attempt just jumping on any Trend so long as there's still that core casual and new which is why you have to hit each one of those points because if you're just going after the new VI if you're just like randomly jumping onto any Trend you can then you're not bringing along your core with you um but yeah it's it's kind of fascinating how many creators come to me and they say like I want to get more views I'm like okay here's more views and they're like oh now that I've got more views I don't like how it means I have to make these more broad videos and it's like it's the classic Trope it's like the classic case of like the the alt band saying they want to make it rich and famous they make it rich and famous and now they're like oh I miss when I was like able to play these small shows and like had this real connection now we have people in the audience who are just wearing t-shirts and don't actually know the music and you know it's the classic kind of like situation but I think it's really it really comes down to the Creator to be really clear to themselves but then also if they if they end up working with someone like me or someone else to be like my my main objective is product sales for this Niche product and in which case I'll be like okay let's instead of focusing on getting you to 10 million views a month let's focus on getting you to two or three million really targeted views per month um and that would actually end up contributing more to the overall business yeah that that leads me to what may sound like a really obvious or weird question but who should be a views maximizer like what is the conditions where views maximization is the right thing to be chasing what what else needs to be true for me I think like the first thing is if if you're main vehicle for generating revenue and we could also get even like very meta on this and say like is even generating Revenue your goal because if a Creator is just like I want to make enough to pay my bills and just really make content I'm passionate about that sometimes can be at odds with generating more Revenue through views you know so like we have to be kind of clear about what we want to do but if you're if your main vehicle for for Revenue generation is AD revenue and I mean that in terms of AdSense on you videos and sponsorships on YouTube videos if that's your main vehicle that you see as the main way to make revenue on your channel you should be a view maximizer in my opinion within reason you know because there's even like you know more deeper arguments around hey like if you go too broad your viewers might not convert as well to um sponsorships and etc etc so like there's there's always these kind of exceptions and things to think about and you know there's a friend of mine who runs a YouTube agency and his name is Dave wiscus if you ever heard of him and he always like talks about how yeah like sometimes these like creators have really viral view counts and they do really well but from a sponsorship perspective the data shows they don't actually convert because they go so broad so like there is like all these kind of exceptions things to think about things to take into consideration but most channels could benefit from having a mindset of I want to get more views and I want to like build out a bigger audience especially people that are like still maybe below that line of being able to make a full-time living from it so I I would say the only people I would discount are people that are looking at it and saying hey I can make more money by focusing on a very small specific group of viewers and those people might be people who sell like a product a course like if you're selling like a course let's say you're selling a course on how to like you know effectively use slack you know as a as a manager you want to Target managers that use slack in the organization you don't want to make a video like you know I use slack for 3,000 hours I used every product tool for like stuff like that might not really bring in the right kind of viewership for you so I think getting really clear about where your main vehicle for generating revenue is but I would say most people their main vehicle is still ad sales um through AdSense or through sponsorship and through maybe Affiliates and other things as opposed to a product even for people with the product though there's still more of that viewership that you can attract you just have to be a bit more tactful you don't you don't want to just completely go and say hey I'm just going to try and make the most Mr beastify viral video I can it's more about within my Niche what can I do so I'm just even thinking of an example like let's just say you're you are this slack example we gave you sell a course on how to use slack as a manager so making like a really weird viral video where you're like trying to like go viral with slack in some way probably isn't a great idea but making a video that follows a trend that has gone super viral across multiple niches which is if I was to start over with Slack here's what i' do we've seen that go viral like if I had to start coding all over again here's what i' do if I started to learn web design over again here's what I do you'll see these examples of plenty of outliers so as that channel you could look at that and model off that video and say hey could I do that for slack maybe it won't get 500,000 views but if I'm used to getting a th000 views a video and that gets 30,000 views we have maximized views you know we've increased views and we brought in the right kind of viewership so I think for channels that just have a specific vehicle they sell to through a specific Revenue generating vehicle like a product or like something more Niche you have to still think about it as core casual new but in this case your new viewer is not going to be just a complete casual your new viewers maybe just like still someone that uses slack but just isn't like your exact customer profile I'm curious to hear what are some of the aspects or similarities across videos and different niches that you see lead to virality what are the what are the commonalities of videos across niches that all go viral so I'd really like to make it very simple number one the video has to have CCN fit so we've already talked about that core casual new fit we won't dive into that again but the first thing should be does this idea have interest across all those bases I I've referenced this before in the past but like even for my channel when I was active on my own Channel with my own name like I would look at it and say the world's biggest Creator needs to be able to watch this and and my mother needs to be able to watch this you know someone who is like an absolute hardcore YouTube Nerd and then also someone that's just roughly interested in the whole platform so core casual new a second trait of viral videos that I look for for any nich is some form of unique novelty value something about it that makes this video just feel like it's its own thing its own Island and not just like another you know screaming into the void idea something unique so we talked about that Andrew millison um example of you know the UN holding back the Sahara Desert like that feels like he has some information something new that I don't know that I haven't heard before so always looking for that like what is unique what is novel about what I can talk about and that kind of goes into why we should spend so much time on brainstorming and trying to find new fresh things for our Niche so that's another thing sounds simple but number three easy to convey entitle and thumbnail so many great ideas are hard to convey entitle thumbnail and they're just not great ideas then they're just you know they're just interesting things they're not great ideas CU a great idea has to be easy to convey in a title th mail um and I get really annoyed at YouTubers saying I've got this amazing idea I just kind of think give had to thumbnail it and I'm like you don't have an amazing idea then so that would be the third thing like making sure you convey in the title F out really easily and then the fourth thing that I always look for is like other people in your Niche or even friends that like have similar interest to you when you mention the idea to them do they get excited like do they just genuinely feel like oh that's interesting that's exciting and I I always like this idea of building a bit of a council around yourselves like a YouTube Council around yourselves so that you can ask people like hey I'm thinking you're doing this like do you find that interesting do you find that you know does that make you excited so when I'm when I'm looking at these niches like if you just start applying these little Frameworks to like how you think about it even the first one just being CCN fit you're naturally going to start looking at bigger videos you're not going to just look at like a really specific thing let's just take another Niche for example so um it's just they give another channnel 731 Woodworks it's a woodworking Channel now I think woodworking is really interesting but you could argue that like it's not a niche that you can Mr beastify it's not a niche you can like make viral because it's just all about like tools and whatever if you look at that channel um a lot of the videos are built around viral formats they are things like testing hacks testing woodworking hacks or 99% of Woodworkers get this thing wrong or you know this tool is now illegal in seven and a half States or you know there there's just like these these funny ideas that are built around just like looking at the idea and saying okay my core is like hardcore Woodworkers but how do we also make these topics interesting to people that like do it as more of a hobby or maybe they're just generally interested in making things but they're not like a hardcore woodworker so instead of being like reviewing the uh you know wood Tron woodsa 3,400 um Second Edition it's just like this tool is so good it should be illegal or um reviewing the uh the most expensive woodworking tool in the world or comparing the wish you know saw to like this $500 saw you know like he's looking at it and saying how can I make things Broad and viral so um yeah I think it is really just about looking bigger and just thinking of unique novel Broad and some of these other traits we've mentioned for these viral videos across niches what about their packaging gets people to click how do you think about title and thumbnail so that people want to actually click I would always say like too too many people get caught up in the like the design itself like the Aesthetics so often I just look at it and say it's showing something simple so you can look at it um I'm not even sure maybe we talked about this on the last podcast but I always like this idea of the glance test sometimes I'll put my thumb on a Google slide and the slide before I'll have just a blank white Slide the slide after I'll have a blank white slide and I'll just flick onto the thumbnail slide really quickly and I'll keep the thumbnail quite small as well and I'll just ask myself can I process what's on screen like in that Split Second because people just vastly overestimate how much time the average viewer looks at a thumbnail the average viewer looks at a thumbnail for well under a second like it's going to be milliseconds it's very hard to like study this but the sort of nonperfect scientific stud I've done on this like just from observing people scrolling and just some other tests I've tried like people look at thumbnails for milliseconds so you need to have something in there that's just really easy to process and get across right away so you know this idea I came up with this idea um I don't want to say came up with it because it makes it sound like I take the credit but a few years ago in a video I I mentioned this idea called the three element rule the reason I I I brought that up and the reason why I think a lot of people use it and reference it is because you shouldn't really have more more than three things that the viewer is focusing on in a thumbnail if anything three is even too much like can you just have like one to three little things they have to focus on so if I'm having to look at a face another face an item text over here a logo over here text over down here there's too much in a thumbnail and too many beginners just feel I have all this space let's fill it but if you then go and look at the most viral videos on YouTube so many of them like they have empty space like you know instead of like showing like this saw with like all these things point at it these different arrows is text over here text over there sometimes it's just as simple as just like an arrow a saw and a face or something you know instead of having too much stuff filling up the screen so I think Simplicity is is really important and then just like trying to show something this is always hard to kind of convey in words but trying to show something that looks a little bit it's like on the verge of believable um or unbelievable it's like it's not misleading but it's exaggeration of the thing so like can we show something that you know if we're trying to show the world's uh most expensive saw in a video I don't think it's clickbait to go in and like add some gold onto the saw or like put some shine on it like put like a little like diamond encrusted thing on it or something so we're going in and just enhancing some of the details to just make it feel still it's still not clickbait because we're still showing the world's most expensive saw and the world's most expensive saw probably looks pretty good but we're going in and we're just trying to like make it look a bit more shiny and clickable so I think if you combine Simplicity and exaggeration without going too far in the realm of clickbait you have a really nice formula for for good thumbnails and and also a lot of it is just like you know studying other thumbnails in your Niche like what are the what are people clicking on because like someone would bring up like oh at this Niche people only click on this kind of stuff or like I've even seen in different geographies like for example in um quite a lot of like countries like Singapore or like Malaysia countries um that speak a different language especially Asian countries they actually quite often click on thumbnails with a lot more text in them than in the Western World I've just noticed that um so you know that's always something to think about as well like culture Niche what's working your Niche but generally speaking I don't think you can go wrong by saying let's keep it simple and let's exaggerate something slightly you talk so much about all of the pre-production work with packaging and thinking about an idea how much of a difference does that pre-production really make love that question because I would say the biggest difference I think between top level creators and beginner creators is top level creators we're putting way more time into the pre-production into planning before we make the content whereas a lot of more beginners will just sort of say I want to make this here's roughly how I think about it let's make it you know so putting like real thought into developing these things before we even press record before we even end up writing the script like I want to see like actual details of how this could go because at some level on YouTube it just becomes a game of decision- making and our decisions are like what do we pursue just like how in a really big business like someone like an Amazon they have all these potential they can make money in so many areas they can do it here here here and everywhere but they have to sit in their boardroom and say like out of these 100 opportunities like which are the ones that we should focus our energy on some as a point of frustration for me is when I talk to people who are either beginner YouTubers or a bit more inexperienced or even like people completely outside YouTube Niche like you know the brands that my company works with and different people they will look at it and they will kind of be a little bit put out or a little bit sometimes honestly frustrated with me with how much detail I put on these little little things like you know how much I will push for a certain tile over another title an example I actually bring up quite a lot is um we work at Red Bull that's one of our bigger clients we had this video um a few months ago which was world's fastest camera drone versus F1 car that video I believe has 20 million plus views so that title I think is a great title it's just really simple straight to the point you get it but if we had titled it something else and there were other titles on the drawing board that we could have used if we had titled it something that was maybe 10 or 20% worse the video wouldn't have 10 or 20% less views it might have a fraction of the views it it might have like two or three million views which is still Lots obviously but YouTubers often think of it too linearly and think okay 20% better title yeah the video might get 20% more views but what if I prefer this title or what if I don't like calling it this other title like it's not going to make that much difference can I just call it this title but a 20% better title could mean double triple quadruple it could mean a 100 times more views because YouTube is this exponential game and returns are nonlinear like a 20% better thing might mean the video ends up doing a bit better with more people and then that can lead this snowball in motion which can then lead to more and more and more views so being a bit better with a lot of people can lead to a much bigger return than you can imagine so the reason I push like focusing on title fil focusing on the topic focusing how you present things and this pre-production so hard is because these things make a massive difference and honestly like I can't say how many times in my career I've had I've been in rooms with people where they've been like we like your title Patty but we think we want to go with this title and then I say why and they go like it just feels a bit more aligned to our brand and then I would say okay like aligning to your brand is really important but if I was to say your title will get 1 million views and my one will get 10 million views would you feel the same way and they'd say how can you know that I'm like I don't know that but I do know that Myan is 10 or 20% better and being 10 or 20% better in an infinite exponential game has huge outside returns you know the video won't just get 1.2 million views versus 1 million maybe it will get 1 million versus 10 million so it's one of the reasons I get so excited about these little nerdy small details um and yeah even that example we use from Andrew mson of the the UN Sahara video like that video with like a different title or a slightly different thumbnail that topic might have only got 500,000 views instead of 12 million how do I take that Insight which I agree with and believe and not allow it to paralyze me from publishing at all setting a limit on how long you you give yourself to to overthink I I think some overthinking is fine but just set a limit if you're overthinking a title for week big problem if you're overthinking it for an hour and then after that hour you say I have to come up with something and and stick with it you know just just make that happen so I think setting a time limit and then also like realizing and understanding that there will be always views left on the table like there's not a single video I've worked on in my entire career that we got 100% of the views we could have got every single video I've ever worked on we could have got even more views with something slightly different but it's just a game of getting us close to Perfection as possible but Perfection needs to have a time limit you need some constraint otherwise you'll just not post anything so I think especially for smaller creators like the reason I even bring up this point of like nonlinear returns and how exponential YouTube is is to excite us with the potential we have but when you're a small Creator like it's still so important to just like publish publish videos right because the pursuit of perfection the pursuit of perfection doesn't account for the other factor in that equation which is timeline and the the longer time goes on on the less learning we have the less videos we're publishing the less we're like you know trying to to to make things happen don't know if this analogy will hit but like imagine like you were someone that just always tried to find like the perfect husband or wife forever but then by the time you finally find them you're like 65 and it's like oh you know like in my pursuit of perfection I forgot that the other timeline was was actual time passing so I think that's a a way of thinking about it is we can be perfectionist we can overthink but just for an hour just for two hours not for two weeks it's empowering because it it goes to s a little bit of extra work on the package on the title and thumbnail and the idea can have outsized returns so that's where there's leverage that's where you should put a little bit of extra time because finding a little bit of a breakthrough can have a huge return for you but you're right there has to be a limit otherwise we'll we'll go back and forth forever absolutely the majority of people watching this probably are still feeling like ah my Channel's pretty small I haven't really broken through yet and so I'm wondering if there's like an order of operations when the Channel's small and I'm getting started for which of the core casual and new I should develop first like should I go broad first to try and get in front of a lot of people so that some of those people become core fans or should I start a little bit more narrow develop the core fandom and then broaden out from there what do you do you think about that there's actually it that question really ties in well with a tweet I made yesterday which was how I would grow a YouTube channel from scratch in 12 months 12 steps and I broke the 12 steps into these different phases phase one I called establishment phase two I called improvements and phase three I called optimization so I almost like thinking of like a YouTube's Channel's like growth along those lines first of all you just need to establish yourself like what am I what am I doing I need to start making videos I need to get good at making videos then you need to get into this phase of like now I need to keep improving upon that establishment like improve in all these different areas start thinking about strategy and start thinking about idea generation more deeply and then over time you end up optimizing and tweaking to get to that Final Destination you want to be so for your question I think we're looking more at that like establishment stage so like before we really think about like how do we you know get in depth on all this stuff look at all this data retention curves like we need to figure out like what we are and who we are as a channel and will say throughout my entire career it's always worked better for me to focus more narrow and more at that core first and then expand out over time uh because you just it's you can never go the other way you can't really start like going after the broad and then go more narrow because that's just like what alienate so many of those viewers I think it's it's e also easier to get traction when you're focusing on a bit more of a specific smaller Niche um I'm even thinking back to like when I used to have um music channels like I would start with like a really specific sub genre of a niche of music then I would start building out so if it starts with like French deep uh deep hip-hop or deep bass or something drum and bass then it would like expand a little bit out to like European drama base then even further you know it would just kind of build from a really small core and then grow from there because you can kind of almost look at it like almost like monkey bars to like different places like you you start in here and then because you're here that means that some of this niches overlap okay so now I can sort of expand out to this broader thing with some overlap with my thing and then I can expand out over here and before you know it you can kind of capture more of the total total Niche or total whole niche as itself because like every Niche has like sub niches like we've kind of alluded to but yeah I find it I find it really interesting how like sometimes I I look at a new Creator and immediately they're trying to make these super viral like really broad videos there are examples of where that works um I have a friend James Janny who I reference quite a bit cuz I think he's just such a really great Creator his first few videos got like millions of views like he just he just hit it out the park right away that is the exception survivorship bias is such a real thing with with YouTube if you look at most channels that are now doing 100K 200k 500k a million views a video they started more Niche down so start Niche and expand and grow from there for sure how do I know when I'm moving out of the established phase and into the growth phase where I need to be looking more at data and analytics and things I think some of it is like volume of videos posted so people will argue with with me on this like I'm sure like other strategists might disagree with this but like The more I've realized this like I've been doing this for 10 years now creators just get overwhelmed if you say to a Creator hey you need to start making videos you need to start making two videos a week and you need to learn all about retention curves you need to learn data you need to learn how to like come up with good ideas you need to learn how to package you need to learn all this stuff it can just be like really overwhelming so how do you go from like that establishment phase to that Improvement sort of growth phase I think what you do first is say am I in a consistent you know Cadence of posting videos some people will say Patty you've said in the past that you know a consistent schedule doesn't matter it doesn't matter algorithmically but it can matter a lot mentally and philosophically for yourself to get into like a regular Cadence of posting if you're really good you can post whenever you want but you're not really good at the start so you need to kind of have that repetition over time so the first thing I would look at before moving into that stage is are we posting regularly and have we learned how to make videos you know like this sounds silly but like every YouTuber that we look up to they know how to like roughly make things you know um and there's some examples I think especially in this like new age of create creation where like people can hire editors and th designers earlier in the process but still like even if if I look at myself like I can edit videos I can I could edit a video if you sat down there and sent me the clips for this and put it together I could edit it is it going to be very good no but it'll be passible I can make thumbnails I made thumbnails for years I've made thumbnails for clients like I can go into to photoshop and make thumbnails I have the fundamental skills to be a Creator so I love the idea that in that establishment phase instead of working and thinking about strategy too deeply we're building those fundamental skills we're making videos ideally maybe one or two videos every single week and we're doing that for a period of time where maybe we have 30 40 50 videos posted then we look at it and say okay let's say we got 50 videos posted we have learned the skills in Photoshop and video editing now we have a foundation where we can put strategy on top it's kind of it's kind of frustrating when I see someone put really a lot of effort into strategy and ideation and coming up with like really good ideas but their execution is so weak that they're just wasting those ideas so like at the start I just say make whatever you want like pick your Niche like we need to pick our Niche we need to pick our Niche SL subnation like focusing on that but then from there just make what calls to you make what interests you like make what feel like passionate about some of it will maybe do okay some of it will do terrible the majority probably won't do anything at all um and then over time you can then look at it and say I'm sitting in this position where I've been doing this for four or five months now I have 50 videos posted I've got the fundamental skills if I now put the strategy component on top if I now think about my YouTube studio if I start studying my retention curves if I start putting more effort into brainstorming ideas so instead of just saying I'm going to make whatever I want to we're going to start thinking about it and saying I'm going to put a huge amount of effort into brainstorming I'm going to schedule time each week to brainstorm ideas I'm going to use a process of elimination to make sure I pick the best ideas we start putting more strategy behind it we have a foundation we can build upon so I think before moving into that stage we just need to make sure we're making videos consistently and we're improving and we've got a foundation of skill for you know Photoshop video editing whatever it might be and if that Foundation of skill isn't one you have yourself it's at least having someone on your team that you've built to cover those areas I think that's so true I talked to a lot of creators who are stuck around platform strategy they haven't even decided yet which platforms should I be posting on and they'll ask me like should I do YouTube and YouTube has the most moving parts of any platform in my opinion the most variables that could go wrong and sync the performance of the entire video if you don't do it pretty well you really have to get a lot of things working in concert from the idea to the packaging which is both title and thumbnail uh not just the composition of it but the literal visual design of it then you need to make sure the video starts out really well so you have good retention uh you probably need to keep people's attention throughout the whole video obviously there's just so many each of these things are like their own art form almost and you can get good at all of it and that's what the great YouTubers are doing but it's such an investment of time that in the beginning you need to get reps of doing the whole video so you at least experience and start building the muscle memory of all of these different moving parts and variables involved I couldn't agree more couldn't agree more like sometimes I I actually have been quite reflect of like the advice I've given over the years and like how I've approached things and sometimes I have like this benefit of I've done it for 10 15 years I have this experience these repetitions and we talked a bit earlier about this curse of knowledge bias sometimes I forget like how many little skills go into making a channel happen so to think about like a new viewer being told hey you need to learn how to edit that's hard you need to learn how to do thumbnails that's also hard you need to learn how to like storytelling camera you need to learn how to like you know do some basic lighting color grading do all that stuff and you need to do this every week and you need to come up with ideas and then be like also as well you need to think really deeply about strategy you need to follow what Patty gway says on Twitter where he says he goes through this whole process of like hundreds of ideas and you can just imagine how overwhelming that is so I love the idea of just breaking it down into those different stages and I think that's the best way to grow like a channel from scratch or from smaller to a big Channel or at least a channel doing quite well momentum wise as as fast as possible um and yeah I think like it's kind of when I really break it down like YouTube is unlike any other platform in that it is really really really difficult to get good at but when you get good at it it starts to feel quite easy it starts to feel like you know you can be in this position where earlier in this podcast I said I feel I have the confidence to feel that I can make any nich faral and I haven't had negative reinforcement to tell me I can't you know every time I've done something with someone with enough time we have made progress and we have got viewership and it's quite an easy input output game when you learn what the inputs are but yeah it's Cra Crazy overwhelming to think about starting on YouTube today and having all this information all these people talking saying you need to do this this and this sometimes you just need to take a bit of time to be quiet and make 30 40 50 videos and just learn how to edit and make thumbil on storytale if you do that first few months you're going to have a much better Foundation if I'm looking at other videos that have been successful maybe it's my own videos maybe it's other videos in my Niche maybe it's videos outside of my Niche but I can see that this video had the outcome that I want it had the type of views that I'm looking to get how do I start to understand what made that video successful yeah I think there's a few things I like to do the first thing is just like actually having these prompts so like writing these prompts down maybe you can just actually take a screenshot of the video and put it in a Google doc or a notion or whatever you use for your note taking and just have these prompts instead to just like reflect on them so one prompt I was like is what made this unique so we talked about earlier about how you know viral videos usually have some level of unique novelty value so like what did make this unique like was it something in the topic was it like something specific to this thumbil that made it different to everything else so what made this unique I was like to ask myself like what about the packaging made it special what about the packaging made it an outlier like was there some way they titled it or thumbnailed it that just felt different to how most people in the space do it or just built up upon a bit of a different format than most people something that I think is um super interesting is when I do see these outlier videos like these and when I say outlier I'm thinking like a video that gets three or four times more than the average at minimum on a channel usually when I see an outlier it's not going to be oh they tried a different color grade or oh they upgraded their camera those things matter but they don't have this kind of like exponential difference usually what it's more often about is hey something about the idea itself the title or the thumbnail is what made that such an outlier so I really like to dig into those things and ask myself those questions of made it unique what about the title film now another really good prompt is why did this go viral and others similar to it didn't so there is a lot of survivorship bias at stake here where sometimes people can look at like a video and say oh this went really viral but then if you look deeper you'll see they tried the same video like eight other times that didn't go viral so you have to ask yourself like was this just a lucky break on this video or was there something different or unique about it so I think you can learn a lot by saying hey this person wasn't the first to cover this topic but the other people that covered this topic got 10,000 views and this guy got 150,000 views why like what was let's put them side by side let's look at some differences and how it's actually put together that can make a big difference a lot of it you can never be 100% sure but a lot of it is if you just start reflecting more and digging deeper into that video and just looking at things like the timing as well when it came out how the views trended over time I think that's a really useful way to do it and also I'll give a quick shout out to um to my friend Chucky who's just launched stats um alongside Mr Beast like they have some interesting tools which allows you to like search reverse basically like reverse search a thumbnail so if you have a thumbnail that you see that goes really viral you can place it into their their thumbnail search and it will like look at like other thumbnails um like it so you can see oh were they the first person to come up with this concept or maybe they saw this concept go super viral in another Niche and they tried it in this Niche and that's why it went viral so I think the more like deeper thing here is just taking time to really reflect on a video as oppos to to just being like chalking it down to something really quickly oh it's because they have more money than me or oh it's because they're a bigger Channel or oh it's because XY Z if you actually just sit there and just try to reflect and almost like Journal around why a certain video did well you can learn a lot if I'm looking at my own channel and one of my videos that performed better than I anticipated is there any data in YouTube Studio that you look at that you feel like is a reliable indicator or gives you some sort of unique insight into why a video did better than you might have expected expected honestly there's nothing there's nothing really that just like gives you a definitive answer like here are some things I would look at if a video went way better than expected I would look at the demographics so like is it appealing to a bit of a different audience than usual sometimes I've seen this where like a video goes really viral I'm like digging into why that could be and then I realize oh it's going really viral in a certain country it might be getting a lot of viewership in India and then I try to figure out why is it getting a lot of viewership in India or you know maybe it's going really viral with a different age group to what I'm used to and it's resonating really well there so dig a bit into the demographics and try to figure out if there's any Trends there I look I like to look at device type so going to YouTube Studio clicking Advance mode and looking at device type and seeing are we getting more views on a different device type to usual could that be a reason behind you know the the extra viewership are we like doing really well on this video on TV why could that be well maybe because this video was longer than our average videos and longer videos typically do better on TV or you know start to like build some hypothesis from that I also like to look at the new viewer metric to see like what you know what number of views on this video were new viewers versus returning viewers just to give us an idea of like oh maybe it's just because this video ended up resonating really well with new viewers and then you can bring it back to yourself to ask yourself the question of why why was that the case and obviously just like studying the view Trend over time as well did this get like a lot of views really quickly or did it slowly build did it rank in search traffic sources like where was that traffic coming from so I'm sort of throwing out these different things I'll look at but it all comes back to the fact that you're not going to have like a single thing that says here's exactly why this went viral so much of it is just looking at all the data points looking at all you know about the video and how it performed and taking that time to adequately reflect on it so many creators they just like see something goes viral and they just like spend like three seconds or you know thinking oh that went viral because of this let's just do more of that you know instead of like taking a bit of time to dig into it so um there's no data point there's no magic data point that gives you the reason the video went viral but you can look at these things to sort of paint the picture I always like that metaphor of like data kind of like can start to color in some of the picture but you still need to zoom out and look at the full picture and see oh here's why this video went viral we get a lot of people who ask me hey why did your video with Jenny Hoyos do so well and it's like a hilarious question because if I knew the answer to that I would just do that every time uh but you know it's it's about to cross 3 million views and the one thing that I can point to and say this was definitively different about this video is it had a higher click-through rate in the first 24 hours and so now I just spin myself out saying how do I get the best click-through rate in the first 24 hours uh but it's so hard to know what combination of title and thumbnail amongst the the stable of titles and thumbnails we've thought about which one will be the best one how do you how do you test packaging to try to find the best answer before you actually push it live on a video yeah so I want to dig into this because this is really interesting because CTR itself is a very fickle and in some ways infuriating metric where if you ask me is CTR useful I would say CTR as a metric obviously like the act of people clicking on a video is extremely important so when people say C is useless or not useful then people take the wrong takeaway of saying oh thumbnails don't matter it's just not how you think about it but CTR as an entire metric is very difficult because the more Impressions the video gets the lower the CTR drops typically so you'll probably see even on that Jenny hoya video over time that CTR is probably dropped quite a bit lower but CTR itself as a whole is not very useful but C in the first hour first 24 hours can be a good predictor of success on videos like I've seen that for lots of our clients so when people say CTR is not useful at all I'd point to the fact that there's a very strong correlation between first hour CTR and long-term video performance on a lot of established channels um not all channels but quite often so I would look at it and say even with that video like you know tile thumb Mount now everyone on YouTube or pretty much everyone over the next few weeks is going to have ABC testing so that's like going to be such a big unlock because you can make up a couple different options and like test your theories in action of like which one gets more clicks I would actually with that video Let's just just think about that video for a minute like I would dig a bit deeper though like is it something you did with the design or is it something more to do with like the topic I think it's it's kind of interesting when you see Jenny and and Jenny is like quite young right she's like 18 17 18 um and she just seeing that I think by Nature that just makes it look a bit unique because it's like this very young girl who has figured out like something really really difficult and she's doing so well it's kind of like how there's videos where you see you know this like bring it to the other side but like sometimes I've seen these videos with it's just like an old guy giving advice it's like old gives advice you could probably show that thumb on screen old man gives advice and people ask why did that video go so well I'm like well because you don't usually scroll through your YouTube feed and see this old guy you know giving advice and I think on the same level like this space like this space of content creation and like um you know you know coming up with strategy and YouTube and how to grow I would say it's very I'd say it's generally quite male dominated uh which I think is a shame cuz I I love when I see like uh more female people coming in and talking about this niche as well but it's quite male dominated and it's also quite a lot of like you know guys a bit older um you know guys my age and above um don't want to sound like a boomer or anything but you know I think some people like a little bit older so you see this like younger girl talking about something it just makes it unique right and then also I love how you you titled it and I love how you like put that thumb out text of like you know I can make anything viral I think those are the things I would look at so maybe it's more about the guest and more about you know the perception of that guest and like how you see that how that makes it unique as opposed to like something specific you did in that packaging so if I was you I would start brainstorming like huh is there like any other like really young um upand cominging creators who have like figured it out at a young age so for example I know there's like these kids I've seen do podcasts that are like 16 17 and they're making like 300K a month with like YouTube or SnapChat or something and it's like when you see that you're like part of you feels terrible cuz you're like well when I was 16 you know was making like $3 a month um so like how did that how does that happen but I think there's something unique about that itself so a great example like digging deeper and like some people could look at that and just say oh this went viral because oh we placed the text a little bit to the right or we had this thing in the bottom corner which we don't usually have but it's much more likely around the actual topic the subject material which is I guess the Creator you're interviewing um and how you package that to the viewer than like little details like that let's look at how you vet ideas when I have an idea and I'm thinking okay I want this to hit my core casual new I feel pretty good about that what are the next steps from there for how I prioritize certain video ideas that I have making sure like I always think about this idea of the idea funnel so you have this big funnel that you put ideas into and the end result is your funnel spits out different ideas that you can then like prioritize based on what you're feeling most excited about so like how do we put things into the funnel I was like to say there's three main sources of ideas internal ideas so things that have worked for us in the past so looking internally like what has worked on our channel can we come up with more ideas like that external ideas things that have worked for our competitors or even just other channels across YouTube how can we come up with ideas based on things that have worked for them and then Innovation so just sort of more blue ocean like looking you know across YouTube across different Industries and saying like what's something Innovative and new that I can come up with so if you're contributing lots of ideas into the funnel from those different sources you then pass through to the kind of the filter part part which is your main question here is like how do we actually eliminate them down and I think you know asking yourselves does it have that core casual new VI of fit it's a great question um asking Is it feasible to make happen so like if you went and did brainstorming this is kind of funny when I work with like new strategists because you know I have to I hire strategists from my business and I also like interview and talk to a lot of like upand cominging people and first of all I'll say like people are really good like some of these young kids are such good strategist and I think about YouTube really deeply but the one thing they sometimes don't understand is like limitations and feasibility so they'll be like let's uh let's you know let's say we're brainstorming ideas for like a wildlife Channel and we could say let's come up with an idea which is like I I swam covered in blood uh with like 10 great white sharks it's like yeah that would go viral but it also might kill the Creator so like you know we got to be careful so like thinking about the feasibility of ideas is is is super important so is this feasible can we make it happen another one I get is like people come up with these ideas but it's like you know if you brainstormed for your podcast and said like um how do we get to a million views well if you had Mr Beast on for an episode probably get to a million views but that's also quite difficult because you need to you know get a contact with Jimmy you need to like convince him that it's a good idea you probably need to grow this podcast more before he'd want to do it so like there's all these like things that get in the way so like having that feasibility and using that as a as a score as well is important so like does it f CCN It Is it feasible the title thumbnail as well like can we actually come up with title thumbil like not only can we say yeah we can come up with it can we actually come up with one before we even go further with this like can we come up with the tile we call it and like a rough sketch of the thumbnail that can like eliminate so if you have 100 ideas in the funnel maybe the CCN fit you eliminate like 40 of them because so many videos don't have that feasibility you eliminate like 20 of them so you've got like 40 left right then you say can I come up with title thumbil for them before you know it out of those 40 you have left now you're looking at and saying well only half of I can actually think of what I would title fum Al them so you got 20 left and then some other questions you could ask like am I actually genuinely as a Creator excited and want to make this video because some people are surprised when I say that because I am like I mentioned earlier like a views maximizer someone that just wants to get more views but if if I think about if our goal is to get more views it's not going to really work really well if I keep making the Creditor make these ideas they don't like doing because at some point they're just going to want to not do that anymore they're going to get burnt out so long term that's going to hurt us so it's still important that the Creator like feels passionate and excited about them so even for you yourself as a Creator just looking at it and saying am I excited to interview this person am I excited to do this thing like does this like make me want to make the content maybe then you've got 20 ideas left and that limites it down to 10 then when it comes to the 10 I always like to do this thing which I call the onepage idea development so on a one pager I like to have just a rough thumbnail sketch I like to have a rough title so you have a thumb sketch rough title I like to have a y um Square the Y Square I just like like to list one or two or three points of like why this video is going to work and then I like to just roughly list out like the log line of the videos like roughly what the video is going to be about so if I have 10 ideas left I'm developing each one of those 10 ideas and those those one Pages again I can already hear people saying that's so much work I've done I can do 10 onepage ideas in like an hour or two you know especially when you think about the ideas being such a source for views and momentum across a whole Channel like we can spare an hour or two to develop out these ideas you know they deserve that at least so I've developed them out in this one page I have 10 ideas then I just like to look at it myself I like to ask you know if I've got employees or if I have like other people that are in my Niche or just friends I just like to then present those ideas so instead of getting on a call and saying hey I'm thinking about doing this idea where we swim with a great white shark it's like here's the idea here's the log line what do you think here's the idea here's the log line what do you think and just going through and asking different people's opinion like even you know myself I think I have like a good measure of what a great video is for the different clients we work with but without that like ability to just ask others opinion you're just going to be isolated and you're going to you know Focus too much on your ego and like what you think is right so even I really like to ask just random people like even just like sometimes they get surprised but like maybe there's like a random new editor on a team and I'll be like what's you think of this idea and they're like I don't know I'm just I just started here I'm like no what do you think like do can you could you imagine this one being interesting so asking lots of opinions and then you're left with three or four videos that you want to prioritize and you develop them from there what do you think people are dead wrong about with the current state of YouTube either they have the wrong belief or they completely miss something that is happening that they should be paying attention to I would say the biggest sort of hot take I have on YouTube which shouldn't be a hot take but it is based on how most people think about it is there is no meta there's no like one way one meta to do YouTube and I feel that often times a lot of people try to like declare the New Direction content is going in like all content is moving towards storytelling or all content is moving towards longer videos or you know we've got this guy Sam suluk if you've seen him like people are like look at Sam it shows that thumbnails is dead I even saw this tweet recently where someone was like the thumbnail bubble is about to burst because like you could see like some of these thumbnails on like samsul and like other channels are like focusing on doing less Les editing less th that design but all these things kind of fail to realize how big YouTube is 5 10 years ago there was people that focused on storytelling and made really long videos that were doing well in 5 to 10 years from now there'll be people that make two or three minute videos and don't focus on storytelling that be doing well there's just so much YouTube is so expansive that there's no one way to make content there's no one meta and yet people always just try to say oh it's Mr beastify but even during the peak of what what you could call Mr beastify on YouTube where everyone was complaining about Mr Beast is ruin YouTube if you actually studied the trending videos and the most of our our videos on YouTube about five to 10% you could classify as Mr Beast ofi videos you know so even in this like bubble of everything being this big spectical it still only accounted for like five or 10% of the trending videos and that's only that's what the trending videos if you look across YouTube it's probably still only one or two% of all YouTube viewership is focused on that kind of content so that's not downplaying the impact of Trends that's not downplaying the fact that yes we are moving into a a world right now where YouTube videos are getting a bit longer and people are putting in more storytelling and leaving out you know leaving the sort of really fast retention editing um out a bit more but that's still just a trend it's not the meta you know so like there's no one way to do YouTube there's no one meta things are are super super varied to continue learning from Patty check out our first conversation where we talk even more about his process for coming up with good ideas and thumbnails it's quite lit literally the interview that changed this channel so make sure you grab your notebook [Music]

====== Estudo_Especialista_112_Reacting To YouTubers Thumbnail Mistakes ====== 
I asked members of my mailing list to send me their channels to review and on the form I asked them to write down what they struggled with the most on YouTube and nearly every single one of the 700 plus who applied wrote something that was telling me they couldn't actually see what the biggest problem they had with their channel was so now myself and Aaron who's been helping film Booth clients grow are going to review some of these Brave applicants who sent in their channels and enable you and them to spot the warning signs of this gigantic problem that will stop your Channel Growing in 2023 if you don't fix it so this first channel we're going to look at is from Caitlyn and she's got a cooking channel um she wrote in her form that her biggest struggle right now is a view count and she said I'm having some videos Peak at 40 but others are reaching 100 plus look there's a lot of different reasons why some videos get more views than others but we're just going to look at one thing in particular now to help you solve this Aaron yes I've got this image on screen this is one of Caitlyn's thumbnails in terms of this video what do you think the most important thing for the viewer is to see the end result of the food and what do you think as a result of that the biggest problem with this image is that stopping it getting clicks well it's getting covered up by text and colors so it doesn't really show off the food the way you would want it to that's it it's simplest form that is one of your biggest problems you've got on your Channel right now in all of your thumbnails you're covering the thing the viewer cares about so the simplest way to fix this is to do what this lady's doing the Domestic Geek so Aaron is there anything that sort of you find appealing about the domestic Geeks I mean I'm instantly like my mouth is watering right especially with all the different um you know iced coffees and milkshakes but it's just showing you with like a simple clean image and you know nice and vibrant colors what the result is going to be I'm instantly hungry any other thoughts on uh Caitlyn's thumbnails showing result is probably stronger than showing the process because this one has like more ingredients on it than other things so um really finding a way to show off a hero of your thumbnail so of what people are going to be clicking on but if we use an example of this image here instead of showing the house you're showing the bricks and no one's going to buy a house based on the bricks so perfect point there Aaron all right so there's one more thing we just want to touch on and it's your titles um what do you think is a problem with the title like this well the thing for me is they feel a little bit search based which makes sense in a way but if you really want people to quickly you know see a thumbnail that's striking and then click on a title is you want to add in some kind of intrigue or something that's a little more powerful than just like here's four recipes you really want to draw them in with something like incredibly tasty or super unique or the secret to the best cakes or something like that yeah so what we've got here we want to be keeping our targets below 50 characters if possible so you've got four tasty breakfast recipes which is a good start and then you've made it really specific using Pillsbury dough now what if they're like ah I'm not really interested in Pillsbury day but they should be and actually in the video If you showed them how to use it they might be super interested in it so you kind of have to break down objections viewers might have to clicking on your content and make sure that you're not including anything that might put them off so four tasty breakfast recipes your kids will love if that was your avatars and if they had kids that's the sort of title that would be enough everything else that came across especially full dishes episode two where you've put episode two in that's gonna kill the video of everyone who hasn't seen episode one okay so next up we have MC Metro and they said the problem was this I always feel I have a healthy subscriber count however it's not necessarily proportional to the Views so let's have a look at the channel to see if we can establish how we can help with this so Aaron the second you land on this channel what do you think they could do to get more of their subscribers to come back to their content well really kind of figuring out how to make what you're showing off look nice again it comes back to that hero that we were talking about like these in a way look just like toys whereas you know if you really get in there and figure out like a nice angle with a nice background you can show it off in a way that looks a lot more impressive because these people are obsessed with mini trains anyway so that's what you want to show off yeah so I would think about it like this what to your viewers is the most interesting and fascinating thing about model Railways now I'm going to take a complete guess here Aaron I'm going to get you to take a guess too actually Aaron you guessed first what do you think the most interesting thing to people who like model Railways is how realistic they can look yeah so to me I kind of feel like maybe they love the tiny little details on a train or on a house that make it look super real so the first thing you should be doing when you're coming up with a new thumbnail is researching and looking at other people's thumbnails within your Niche or maybe even outside it too so I did a little bit of an explore and I found a channel who's really doing well uh they're called play London so how to pronounce that but this guy you know 70 000 views on a Model Railway video that's that's pretty impressive stuff sticks out to you about these thumbnails Aaron it looks incredibly realistic the one on the top right I'm like is that even is it fake is it tiny the one below it as well I'm like that just looks like a station until you see the person on the right you know it's it's also incredibly realistic which is really powerful with diorama building yeah I I would click on that as someone who has no interest in this Niche because I can't quite make out if it's real or not and again it goes back to photography here so this this image in particular they've taken this shot with their backgrounds blurred out which makes it look even more realistic right this could be a Hilltop so I think they have really picked up nicely on what the viewers care about and again no no real text on these images it's they're very very simple and you're you know putting some effects and and things on the images but also I think have a play with your lighting as well and and bring up the brightness slightly so that these things stick out a little bit more so next up we have Nikita and he said his problem is attracting new viewers because his Niche is fairly small and limited let's start with the first thing that you can probably get more views with Aaron is there anything that jumps out straight away yeah I mean depending on the angle you want to take you're going again for something that's quite Niche obviously Lord of the Rings is something that is kind of getting popular with the Amazon show coming out but there are other things about beer brewing that are probably even wider uh form of Interest right something like Oktoberfest or another beer brewing Festival is gonna bring in more people with the relevant interest compared to Lord of the Rings yeah so I think you've made the right choice in that you've tried to Target a trend here but the wrong choice in the is law of the Rings associated with beer that much going back and looking at your ideas there are some that work here but I think you've taken a bit of a wild card approach here with the lord of the ring ones I think you should be looking at these other channels so we've got this one called claw hammer and they get quite a lot of views on their videos you know 165 000 in a month is a lot Aaron is there any sort of pattern that you notice straight away which is helping them get those sort of views yeah I mean the thumbnails are quite clear and quite simple you know obviously they're going to the extreme into like expired beers dangerous to drink barely legal but on top of that again we're coming back to that hero in the thumbnail right it's showing off the brew that you're going to be talking about so you tend to find extremes always do well on YouTube Brewing the strongest Homebrew allowable by law you wanna know what happens right and a few things fire up in your mind like what does someone drink it like how strong is it would I be able to drink that and that makes the thumbnail and title really intriguing and highly clickable so these guys have got some fun ideas I think your channel is very much targeted to the people who are already very very interested and that always makes your audience a little bit smaller Aaron if you're going to redesign five things I wish I knew before I started Brewing as a thumbnail and that's a strong title yeah what do you think you'd put in it either something that is super obvious that everyone does when they start brewing or something that is very clearly a mistake um and then have something like some text or an arrow pointing at it saying like don't do this or something like that and I think I just want to talk to you about the thumbnail design is Aaron what does your eye notice as soon as you see this what's the first thing that sticks out to you um things yeah and what is the first thing do you think that should stick out to someone in a video about Brewing brewing equipment or hops something like that yeah something related to the thing they care about that is visually clear so maybe this here maybe this thing here you've covered how do we get around using text if we wanted to stick with this so it doesn't stick out first and stop us from seeing the things that we should actually notice well like I said something like arrows can really help making texts just a little bit smaller um but generally like having the thing that is actually relevant be either in the middle of the frame or a focal point somewhere so really we wouldn't be able to show much of your face here but like this is the interesting bit here so it's getting used to sort of design and photography again one of the things to keep in mind as well is like if something's really small in the corner it might not immediately be obvious what it is to me those could be coffee beans and I would be like yeah sure but they're not right and you want to make that clear I thought they were coffee beans as well actually okay so this next channel is Tim and it's been an interesting problem he said he had or a struggle he said his biggest struggle was on camera presence and I say it's not on camera Presence at all Tim you are a street photography Channel Aaron as a street photography Channel what do we need to see in these thumbnails street photography and as much as these are amazing images right it doesn't give us the contact as to what it is um a lot of the photos just are like reflections of things and you know things through glass or in the rain but if you want to show off street photography it's great to have that context rather than having London or Bristol as a word having you know London at night or Bristol streets or whatever it is in the image is really going to help you get that across more I know that your style is a bit more abstract but look here it's from Jason vong five prices street photography tips so he's got this thumbnail uh where the guy in the orange jackets contrasting it looks like a street in its simplest form I found another one as well that I thought was really clear street photography this is from someone called Pierre and scope by is most viewed here you know five must know street photography tips he's in the street on the floor so one thing I think you should try is this you don't necessarily need to leave your sort of abstract style but in this latest video how to use Reflections to add depth and layers Aaron what would you do if that was you well so I probably either not use text or have it in a way that's a little bit more meaningful and then make it more obvious that it's a reflection because I can see it but I don't know if it's clear to anyone else who is looking at this with you know less of a photography background it looks amazing but I don't know what I'm looking at necessarily Aaron anything you want to add on the titles yeah I mean as you can kind of tell right that almost all of these are being cut off which probably means they're a little bit long again really rather than just leading with street photography or you want to build a question in the mind of the person seeing your thumbnail in titles so again something that is size something short that really like emphasizes the point you're talking about secret to amazing Street night photography or something along those lines it's going to be more powerful than street photography at night in London yeah you're kind of like saying exactly what it's about we need a bit more Intrigue there so then our final Channel biggest struggle here was how to break through the 10K views faster per video If you want to get more views faster you need more clicks guess what we're going to be looking at right now I wonder if it's titles and thumbnails it is the biggest Blocker on YouTube hopefully by now you're starting to see a pattern as a viewer Aaron what are the problems with these thumbnails so this is about kite surfing right and people who love kite surfing love the action of it the feeling of it you know the wind and the waves and the season really showing much of that action text is covering things there's you know bits and pieces different pictures in one image I want to see just like you on a kite surfboard is that what it's called having the best time of your life because that's the thing people want to connect to when they're not kitesurfing right as opposed to someone walking on a beach that's not necessarily relevant as much to that person so this is a thumbnail yeah uh or just type in kite surfing on Google these images you're selling people the dream that's why you need to show them the thing that they love and at the moment it's just too clogged up especially this one in particular this is committing a crime I call the inside joke so if you put something in your thumbnail image that the viewer will only understand once they've watched your video it's not helpful to get a click so you've got Morpheus but why is he in the thumbnail I think get rid of him get rid of all the text have just this nice shot of you kite surfing maybe pump the saturation up a little bit and play with the contrast and you're gonna break way more views so then let's have a look at the titles here as well keep your hair dry while kiting uh again is a title that feels long and has a whole chunk that isn't necessarily relevant or building that Intrigue you know kinds of interesting transition in three steps might just be enough on its own I still feel like there might be a more powerful way of really getting people to be like oh I want to click on this because it's something that they recognize or something that makes it feel like you know something they don't but yeah again like is keeping your hair dryer just about getting wet or not so keeping your hair dry is is going to be a term for not falling in okay this is about kite surfing transitions you can do that mean you won't fall off you could probably just show a comparison and I talk about these thumbnails a lot because it's so powerful left hand side of the screen show the thing they shouldn't be doing with the cross right hand side show the thing they should be doing or the left hand side could even just be you on the kiteboard trying to get back on soaking wet and the one on the other side is you having a great time with dry hair if you say keep your hair dry it doesn't necessarily instantly mean that much unless that is a term within the niche that everyone understands what about the new people who don't thank you so much to our brave applicants you all will be sent 100 as a thank you and if you want to sign up for my next Channel review video and get the ability to have your questions answered and exclusive content then check out the link below but more importantly make 2023 the year you take your thumbnails to the next level because it really is one of the ultimate reasons channels don't grow but also you want to be making sure that the experience

Finally, we have reached 50k subscribers, and for that, thank you so much. But the average views on my channel are just 10 to 15k. Because 3.7 million videos are uploaded Everyday On YouTube 3.7 million In Hindi-language educational content, the RPM (Revenue per Mile), meaning the earnings per 1000 views, is around 10 to 40 rupees. But in foreign countries, or the content that people from abroad watch in English, their RPM is 300 to 800 rupees. You'll find thousands of tutorials on YouTube about how people earn lakhs of rupees, and thousands of motivational videos. But this video is going to be the exact opposite —more like a demotivational one. Motivating someone for the short term is no big deal. That can even be done just with sound design. But that won’t actually have any impact on your life or change your quality of life. The feeling I have after three years, you shouldn't have that. In 2024, choosing YouTube as a career? It could prove to be a big mistake. By creating content on youtube for 2-3 years and by observing fellow creators. I’ll be sharing what I’ve learned And yes, if you're afraid of reality and want to become like those motivational speakers, making money by any means possible, then stop watching this video right now, and don’t forget to hit the dislike button. If you open Instagram or watch any podcast where money is being discussed, you’ll immediately start feeling like a loser. Because nowadays, no one seems to have an income of less than 5 lakhs on social media. Even if you’re earning ₹1 lakh, you’ll still feel like a beggar, because those people are earning 10-15 lakhs per month, and that too at the age of 20. Some are just 13 years old, and some haven’t even come out of their mother’s womb yet. To prove this, they won’t show you their bank balance or their real method of work. by just looking at the dark circles under their eyes, you’ll have to understand They’ll tell you about some mind-blowing business model like dropshipping, video editing agencies, YouTube automation, etc. Tech Burner said something very valuable: "there’s a huge difference between being good and showing on the internet that you’re good." Because of these reels and countless podcast clips, the illusion that’s been created—stay away from it. Otherwise, it will distract you a lot and steal your peace of mind. You won’t even be able to make decisions, and then you’ll end up following their roadmap. Finally, I quit my job and going to live dream life. I left everything for passion— this is becoming a common phrase now. But think about it: a 9 to 5 job doesn’t inherently mean it’s bad. You also need skills and hard work to get it. Make decisions not in excitement but with responsibilities in mind. God gave us enthusiasm along with Brain; sometimes you should use that too. 9 to 5 jobs are called the rat race because you have to follow the same boring routine every day. So, why am I now calling YouTube a rat race? Let's go back a little. I started my YouTube channel out of passion, a passion for clicking photos. When I grew a little, I started making content for the audience because I wanted to grow more. This way, photography faded away. I completely stopped going outside with my camera. I had to shift my full attention towards videography, and I started enjoying that too. But again, to grow in this field, I had to keep doing the same work repeatedly. I started uploading one content piece every week. Gradually, the scripts for the videos became more complex, the editing process became more time-consuming, and now I’ve reached a point where it takes me two to three days to write a script, and it takes me three days to edit a video. So now, what's happening is that I’m spending the entire day in front of the computer screen, locked in a room. After a few days like this, a word starting with “p” completely disappeared. I had said in a video that I’m very happy turning my passion into a profession, but now I realize that’s not the case. Because think about it carefully —if you have to do something you once did out of your own will, but now you have to do it under pressure, repeatedly, your love for it will fade away. You love eating biryani, but if you are given biryani for lunch and dinner every day, after a week, just the name of biryani will make you feel nauseous. This creates the feeling of burnout. Now, some people can balance this life and keep growing with that mindset. And then they fall into the same rat race, which is no different from a 9-5 job, or even worse. Because for the job, you were mentally prepared in advance that you’d have to do this. But for this career, you expected something entirely different. To sustain this, you need capability, which varies from person to person. It would have been easier to sustain if the rewards were better. I’ve already mentioned how much the RPM is for educational content in Hindi. So, if you still want to get trapped in this rat race, do it by being mentally prepared. Look at my situation at first I used to upload four videos in a month, then three, and now I’ve stopped at two. I don't know, maybe it will become one someday. And even now, I’m able to upload this content the only reason  is because of sponsors. And this video is sponsored by HitPaw Video Enhancer, which allows you not only to enhance any video but also repair various types of damages, whether it's flickering, unplayable videos, screen loss, or even restoring sound. So, let's test the video enhancer. Click on 'Import Video File' and select your low-resolution video. Since it's a face video, the automatic face model has already been selected here. Now, just click on 'Preview Effect'. In just a few seconds, the preview will be ready. The enhancement has been done really well, but the color has gotten a little messed up, so we will exit the preview and select 'Soften' for the face model, then tap on 'Preview' again, and as you can see, now it's enhanced perfectly. The original video was in 240p, and we have converted it to 4K. Now, we'll just export it from here. Now, let's look at AI Background Removal. Import a video from here, and after playing the video, you'll notice that it has complex movements. It will be interesting to see how the background is removed in this. Now, just tap on 'Preview'. In a few seconds, you'll get the video with a transparent background, and you can also check the accuracy. You can apply any color to the background from here. Now, just click on 'Export'. Be sure to check out the link in the description for full details. 5-10 years ago, when there weren’t as many smartphone users, everyone used to say, 'You just need one viral video.' Meaning, if one video on your channel goes viral, you’ll be established. But today, that has completely changed. Today, having a viral video isn’t a big deal. Subscriber count has no value today. In the early days, there were a limited number of creators in every niche. That’s why the audience used to subscribe to them and only watch their videos. They would build a brand. But today, in every niche, there are millions of creators. If someone likes one of their videos, they immediately hit subscribe, but no one watches all their videos. Now people have many options, and now there’s also Shorts. So, just watching Shorts consumes the entire day. So now, through long-form content building a brand and identity has become very difficult. Let me show you proof. Alright, maybe I make bad content, that’s why my average views are low. But Anithing has 7 lakh subscribers, and their average views are between 1 lakh and 3 lakh. NSB Pictures has 14 lakh subscribers, but the average views are still between 1 lakh and 3 lakh Ankit Bhatiya has 10 lakh subscribers, and his average views are 2 to 3 lakh. Besides that, many good channels are posting fewer videos due to burnout and the huge fluctuation in views. The simple truth is that the immature audience enjoys being fooled. And if you try to build a brand through short-form content, how many brands will people remember? On Instagram, anyone with 10,000 followers considers themselves to have built their own brand. So today, building a brand and a strong audience base is impossible. Views will always fluctuate a lot, no matter how authentic you are. You must have seen this concept, where a carrot is dangled in front of a donkey, and to eat it, the donkey starts walking and keeps walking. But it never actually reaches the carrot. The owner by using that one carrot, takes advantage of the donkey's struggle Similarly, there are some people who want many struggling creators to exist. And they also have just one carrot, which is the skill of manipulating people's thoughts. 'How to grow your YouTube channel,' 'How to make money.' 'How to make viral videos,' Okay, let's say I'm wrong. But think about it, if their advice actually worked, then why is there a need to make more videos on the same topic? But if you check their channels, Then the first video is: 'How to complete 4000 hours of watch time.' Then, after 2-3 videos: 'How to complete 4000 hours of watch time in one day.' Then, after another couple of videos: 'How to get 4000 hours of watch time with just one video.' Why is there a need to keep doing this? The more you struggle, the more they benefit. You are the product. They'll teach you how to get views on your videos but can't get views on their own videos. These people want as many struggling creators as possible, who will watch their videos to escape the struggle and keep watching forever. My channel only started growing when I stopped following their channels. Mr. Beast always says, 'Just focus on creating the best possible video, that's it.' In their business model, if you want to make money, all you have to do is fool people. Even if you're making 30,000, teach people how to make 500,000 per month. And one thing I don't understand, if a person knows 122 ways to earn millions, why aren't they doing those things themselves? Instead, they're teaching you. It's all about the RPM, dear, the RPM trap. Isn't this something like Ambani quitting business to open a YouTube channel and teach you how to make millions from the telecommunication business? If you don't know anything, just teach people how to make money. So please, stay away from these real vampires who are turning your struggle into their business. Just as not everyone with a white beard is a guru, similarly, people who don’t look at the camera while speaking into a studio mic aren’t necessarily worthy of giving advice. Some advice sounds good but is actually useless. For example: Always be surrounded by rich-minded people; you’ll become like those you associate with. So, if someone’s parents are poor, should you kick them out of your house? a friend who has been with you since childhood just because he is poor or have a poor mentality Will you abandon him ? Advice-givers will only keep giving advice (like me). In difficult times, a friend will be more useful. Life is a race. If life is a race, then the one who dies first wins. So, just die now. Forget this nonsense. Life is life; live it well. What success means to you is something only you will decide. No one eles You can be happy even with less money. Not everyone needs bungalows and BMWs to be happy. Some people are very happy earning 15-20 thousand and living with their family. So stop taking advice from everyone. Try to spend time with family and friends. Remember one thing, you can always earn more money, but the time that has passed cannot be brought back. Respect even a poor person; this is life, and they have experience. Free advise Whatever you do, don't think of building a career solely by starting an editing channel. Freelancers are now looking to shift to full-time YouTube, and creators are looking for freelance work. Living on one bank of the river always makes the other bank look better. After struggling for 3 years, and then changing your decision it's better to be prepared beforehand. There’s no need to leave anything to create content on YouTube. If you have a job, continue with it and do YouTube alongside it. All of these points might not apply to you if you make videos in the entertaining niche. However, if you want to create educational content as a video editor, it’s better to allocate 40% of your time to it while doing other work as well. I am also doing some freelancing work today and thinking of doing something offline as well. Just like COVID-19 halted offline work for a while, some incident might also stop online work Now, every situation has exceptions; if you are very talented, your situation might be different. But I am speaking from the perspective of an average person. And I hope this helps my 10 to 12k viewers In this video, I’ve discussed a lot of good and bad points, with the sole aim of helping some people make their decisions better. So if anyone feels bad about my comments, I sincerely apologize. And for creating different moods in every part of this video, I used different types of lighting, which will also improve your visual storytelling if you watch my cinematography series videos. See you soon in the next video. Until then, bye.

====== Estudo_Especialista_139_What Is Working on YouTube Now  (10 Trends) ====== 
excited for this stream because we're going to be talking about 10 viral trends that you need to try and really what's working on YouTube right now we've done a lot of research and I'm going to be joined today by Nate from the think media team who's crushing it on YouTube in his own right making videos on this channel filmmaker and who also has been to some events recently kind of in the YouTube industry so we've done hours of research we've gone deep analyzed our own channels and you can check out time codes and chapters to find um the different distinct trends that we are going to be covering and so uh Nathan welcome to the stream you want to dive us right into your presentation and then I'll cover my five Trends in part two absolutely thank you so much for having me so Sean sent us out to vid Summit which is host in Dallas Texas and this is my second year going and got a lot of great resources out of this year in particular so I want to talk a little bit about what is working on YouTube specially this year but also going further and Beyond 2024 and some of the latest trends that different people have covered so let's go ahead and let's dive straight into it so this was a big light bulb moment for me we had Todd bupre kind of like the algorithm guy behind YouTube explaining most creators think when I ask you like what do you think the YouTube algorithm is you know you might think once I post up a video is going to try to put that video where it wants to go and try to get as much views as possible well that's the wrong way to look at it YouTube does not look at the algorithm like that instead the reality is they look at YouTube very much for the viewer so when you log on to YouTube as a consumer you're watching it it's going to try to figure out what videos you're interested in so the algorithm is really dependent on each person watching your video Someone side by side is not going to get the same recommendations as you do no matter how good your video is so we're going to talk a few things about how it chooses to put out your video but first that's just a big relight you know we need to stop thinking about how YouTube is trying to make our Channel popular instead we need to dive and think okay how do we focus in on the viewer how do we make sure that we make content that they are actually going to want to watch because that's a b thing so getting in that Fram set I think is the automatic shift for me that I'm like oh you know we hear it so much but sometimes you just need that little encouragement like that real little reset so let's dive into the different reasons or how YouTube chooses to show what videos are seen on the homepage so number one they always say is rule-based recommendations so it's going to look at the viewer subscriptions what videos did they recently watch what are some of the high performing content in that Niche or your audiences are watching so it's going to choose that fundamentally so subscribers are still important you know if you subscribe to a channel that is a good notification that you want more content like that so still encourage people to subscribe if they do enjoy watching that content number two is word of mouth or what they call automated word of mouth so the way they described it is if you go to a movie and let's say you just watched alien Romulus and you loved it well you might go tell your friend hey I think you should watch alien it was amazing um so you now just referred another person to watch that video what YouTube does is it's automatically doing that it's going to kind of predict which a viewer is going to be interested in that same topic and if you watch a video you watch it all the way through you thumbs it up and you share it that's just more indication that it's going to find that similar audience um so if you think about the different viewer and what they're interested in you know if you're this is a big question too people are thinking about is what if I want to change niches or change topics well there are chances that they're interested in other similar things so if I do a video about film making there's a good chance that people are interested in movies or other things like that and I just don't have to be stuck in gear reviews if that makes sense the third method is algorithmic personalization so again it's tailoring each video based off the viewers unique interest and viewing habits even beyond the YouTube platform which was a little concerning because YouTube they're a data company and so they they they have a lot of data and so they can kind of tell based off your interest your demographics what interest you might have in general if you're more sportsy if you like to go on Hikes it can kind of defer what videos are going to be seen around them so those are a few ways that YouTube chooses what video is going to be placed on that home feed or the suggestions feed what I also recommend um and this was another thing that was really quite interesting is if you ever opened up your YouTube studio and you scroll through and you see related videos and where are all your views coming from so people are watching a video and they go to click on your video there is a setting YouTube has in there where it will show the related videos it's suggesting I've noticed this for a long time that I would to get really weird recommendations like it was totally different from my Niche and I was thinking man YouTube just does not understand my audience or my channel but the way they described it makes it makes a lot of sense sometimes if you subscribe to a channel you may not watch a video immediately you know you you may not watch on the subscription feed box but you might see it as a suggestion and you might click on that so in the same way we would watch TV and we would change channels right people have that same viewing pattern so we will go from watching aliens and we'll go to watching uh cooking recipes you know on a dime just because we're interested in that topic so do keep that in mind if your kind of algorithm doesn't seem like it's working it's actually just viewer behavior and that's all you YouTube is really trying to do is just cater to the viewer and what they're interested in and sometimes it seems a little weird but ultimately we're getting closer to what the viewer actually wants to watch Sean do you have anything you want to say there no I love it I'm just gonna hang out I will say as we're talking about Trends and for those that are just jumping on um you're hitting this first one here and I've got five towards the second half and so we're talking about the YouTube algorithm misconception versus reality and um ultimately I've learned lately that consumption is the new subscription and so it kind of ties into this where the YouTube algorithm the most valuable currency these days is someone watching a YouTube video almost more so than someone clicking this subscribe button because if someone clicks subscribe it doesn't mean they're seeing your videos but if somebody's watching your videos it actually probably does mean YouTube's going to suggest more of your videos so more valuable than a subscri these days is minutes of watch time and consumption and this kind of just ties into how the algorithms working have you noticed that as well Nate definitely that's actually what they kind of talked about is the um long form being such a huge proponent I'm G to skip forward here uh long form just being on the rise because I feel like this for myself when I'm watching I might have YouTube on my TV I'm in a different viewing pattern where you know a few years ago it would took it a lot for me to watch a 30 minute view video but now I just pop on a 30 minute long video and I'll be working you know just listening to a video it's very different than how we consume YouTube before and so and just kind of give a quick little preview Colin Samir actually talked about that being the key to success on YouTube is creating a relat a repeatable long form format and Sean I know you talked about you know creating one highquality valuable video per week you know if you can maintain that consistency and make it repeatable and make it kind of lengthy you're going to have a much better chance at getting that watch time more ad Revenue more likely for YouTube to suggest your video I feel like it's less competitive when you have a longer video when it's more in depth than just something short that you can easily put out yeah you know it's interesting I was watching this podcast uh called the deep end with Taylor Welch and before subscribing the simple fact that I started one of the episodes of video podcast and let it play now Taylor is following me everywhere including my shorts feed so he's in my shorts feed other videos are showing up your consumption like the way the algorithm Works we're tying in a couple Trends together so I'll kick it back to you but you're talking about the YouTube algorithm it's one of the big trends understanding how it works creating the right content and understanding viewer behavior and then I think the second one you're hitting is long form content is on the rise and uh we'd love to know Trends are you seeing if you're watching this um are you consuming more long form content just short form content but I'll kick it back to you for uh the next tip here yeah I'm just going to kind of briefly go back to the algorithm one thing that YouTube is actively working on is they're utilizing Ai and large language models to better understand what your video is about so if you ever notice you know captions pop out on your video or the transcription box that you know YouTube has a great understanding of what your video the context is so even when you mention if you craft a video for specific title keyword like we talk about then understanding what that video is is what the algorithm is trying to understand the best way they describe this is YouTube is instead of if they're serving out a video like a recipe they're not just following a recipe they're trying to like understand the mentality of like how to cook so like if you're interested in this particular topic maybe you want to go deeper on it or not just because it's titled similarly but it's in the same world so being able to understand more about what the individual is is going to help it put it in front of the audience so many times we're struggling getting the viewer to actually watch our video but just remember the other half of this YouTube is wanting for people to watch your video so they're trying their best to understand what your video is and so the more we can help about the algorithm by providing or you know just being more valuable and thoughtful of how we're presenting our video is also going to help combine with the power of YouTube to better understand the content and context of our videos and that's going to put it in front of the right people but now let's move on to long form content like I teached earlier so there's three really big reasons that they've noticed about long form video and when we mean long form video it can mean anything from like eight minutes plus but they kind of defined it as you know since 2020 um 20 plus minute long videos have been on the rise more AdSense more Revenue has been flowing into that and people are watching longer videos sometimes I get caught up watching you know a longer podcast two hours I'm like whoa you know that's totally different than what I used to watch back in the day so just keep in mind that you know having a longer video YouTube is incentivized to keep people on their platform so if a longer video is keeping people engaged they're going to likely recommend that over the last 16 months long form content has seen an rise in AdSense Revenue so that's why it's another indicator for why we should be making that we all want to earn money on this platform and that can be a stepping stone towards you know if you're planning to go full-time on YouTube and also viewer preference like people are just naturally wanting longer more in-depth content I think we've all been inundated with short form content and we watch it but I don't know about you but when I'm watching a short I find kind of feel gross after you know watching a 30 40 minutes and I don't feel satisfied but if I watch an hour and 30 minute long movie or two hour movie like I feel satisfied by that um and I think that's like a different thing we have to kind of keep mind is the longer video you can go more in depth you can be more personal and like we'll mention later on the stream is you can build more connection to your audience so those are all things you can utilize just keeping a note on long form is really the best place to be and like I mentioned earlier Colin Samir great YouTubers they were there speaking and something that they said really stood out to me the key to success on YouTube in 2024 is creating a repeatable long form format and Sean you've said something similar to that but I think that's very true and that's something we definitely experimented on our podcast channel on this channel and Sean you've been doing a lot more of these deeper Dives 20 minute long videos and releasing those every Wednesday like I think that is exactly what this is it's a repeatable long form format and you know you look at the viewership on those videos they're l more in depth people resonate with those and in turn YouTube is likely to recommend those as we've seen so that's long form let's talk about short form because I think there's two worlds we kind of have to be a part of and you know short form can be hard to necessarily grow and sustain for long form and people often ask us like how do you convert your shorts viewers to long form and that's kind of tricky because we've explained it before it's like two different people two different audiences right so what was interesting is creators who utilize shorts well see an average of 10% increase on their long form views so what does that mean it doesn't necessarily mean by posting shorts you're gonna get 10% more views but if we kind of take it step by step here one creator that was an example of this is Max fos so he does does like these YouTube pranks elaborate videos and he uses his YouTube shorts as a kind of a trailer for his longer video so he kind of give a brief 60- second synopsis of his video and then he like leaves the last hook like he's going to do something outrageous he says but click the link click the related short to watch the full thing and you might be divided on that but the idea is you know getting millions and millions of views from these shorts that are feeding to long form so he's a key example of you know while he is making a great shorts he's also making the long form and by people just watching the shorts YouTube is naturally going to recommend that long form video and you may not automatically switch to it each viewer who's watching shorts may not actually click the related shorts button but in general you're going to see an increase and they said roughly around 10% on average creators who are using shorts well will see that increase in their long form views which is super cool to see you have any thoughts on that yeah I've noticed that Trend as well certain shorts with good storytelling that not only hook me into the 60c version but are architected not just trimmed out of the longer video but create the open loop see the full video on the channel use the related um video feature to link to the long form video I think that from and you're mentioning Max fos as an example of this you know I think that one of the things we've noticed is it seems like it's a small percentage of people who click the related video and not even that we've been doing it at a world- class level but the simple fact is that shorts can get we have a short that just is over 10 million views so a small percentage of millions of views potentially or hundreds of thousands depending on your Niche if you're watching this it could still be a major impact in moving shorts viewers over to long form so I think that is a um a cool Trend and if you're just jumping on Nate's breaking down some of the insights he learned at vidsummit uh recently with uh darl EES and all the awesome speakers over there and then in the second part of this I've also got five Trends I've spotted and we're curious which one do you like best because whether that's tapping into shorts we've been talking about the personalization of the algorithm long form content on the rise and so um things you can apply to your channel to get better results in the coming weeks and months I see a quick question here that says what do you mean by repeatable that's a great question I kind of glanced over that but you know we can often make a long form video and we could do it really well but by the end of that video you're just exhausted you don't upload for months so what is an I would say a relatively easy way but if you think about your workflow of making a video what is something that you could actually repeat that could be a podcast that could be a longer Vlog that could be a sit down talking video if you want a good example of this I think Sean's did a great job with his Q&A videos he's been doing so like every Wednesday we've been dropping these videos and those are him talking in front of the camera yes there's some editing there's some Polish but fundamentally he's answering a question so I think that's a great way to start implementing this is looking at ways that you can actually come up with what we call a format something like a show you could repeat you know imagine if you watched Food Network and suddenly they're watching you know you suddenly you're watching Food Network and then all of a sudden you're watching something completely different on the show you wouldn't be tuned in so having that consistency really matters and here's a great example of those Q&A videos again yeah newest the newest show at thick media and I mean it's similar to other stuff but it's a format kind of dialed in with the workflow it's based off of one viewer question and then I spin up the episode around it of course for the season of life we're in blessed to have help with editing and whatnot but for any solo Creator the the the question being what does repeatable mean I think sustainable it's like that you don't you can only make one video a year because you had to all the Blood Sweat and Tears and fatigue that it took that's one reasons why video podcasting is so popular is because it's sustainable if you're interviewing other people or whatnot you don't have to always be coming up with your own original ideas you just need to book guests and have good questions so I think that's a deep question to ask yourself what is a repeatable long form show or what is a repeatable sustainable content format for your channel that can help you grow but also not burn out in the process love it let's head back into the slides here and again here's another demonstration of just the increase 10% on long form um we're gonna talk about a little bit of hook structure and just how do you you might earn the viewers click but how do you actually keep them watching so there's three key elements that they were talking about and really you need to capture your audience ATT attention within the first five to 10 seconds so we've heard you know first 30 seconds but really it's that 5 to 10 seconds where they want to know are you going to fulfill on the promise that they clicked on you know if you titled a video best camera for YouTube and then the first few seconds is talking about something completely different people are likely going to click off so engaging making it interesting can be another thing visually interesting you know using sound effects or whatnot but really just understanding what your viewer clicked on the video for then we talk about story a compelling narrative that keeps keeps your viewers engaged and invested this is a big thing that I heard multiple times is storytelling storytelling what does that mean for a YouTube video especially since most of us are in the education space now I'm a little biased I'm a filmmaker I like telling stories but I myself I was like questioning like all right how do I bring in story to like a gear video right when's the appropriate time for that well if we distill storytelling and we just think of it as change right that could be a change of mindset that could be a change I've had this problem and now I fixed it you know towards the end that is an element of change in storytelling so I think you can kind of one thing I really try to be mindful of when I'm making YouTube videos is just being in the shoes of that viewer so if there's a paino if they're talking about I did a video called how to edit a YouTube video for beginners right I'm edited for several years now so maybe I've lost a little bit of touch of those pain points that seem so natural now right but if I can put myself in the shoes of those who've never touched editing at all they don't know what certain words mean you know they don't know exactly how to um they may be following along but they not understand the certain words you're using so to really like distill down what's the pain point of my viewer and identif in that and if you can provide that Solution that's also a form of story and then the payoff you know if you provide that solution to the viewer you know there's a sense of relief there's a sense of accomplishment now they don't have that problem or that burden anymore so I think that's like an easy way for an educational to incorporate some video structure that's going to keep people engaged um back off a little bit let's talk a little bit more about story I think we're hearing this more and more um about storytelling on YouTube and there were some great filmmakers at vidsummit and they're talking about um most YouTube videos you know we're great on teaching people the information but we don't necessarily there's a whole other side of humans not just the knowledge but it's it's the feeling the emotion and you can tap into that as a Creator how do you want the viewer to feel while watching your video if it's a comedy channel hopefully you want to make them laugh if it's an educational video you want to make them feel understood safe and that they can actually learn and digest the video they don't feel like an idiot you know those are a few good places to kind of try to focus on how you want your viewers to feel um I'm gonna switch topics a little bit Sean unless you have anything last to say we'll head into some thumbnail critiques and what's working but do you have any last thoughts on that no I love it you're you're dropping fire and if you're getting value you can smash the like button for the YouTube algorithm and Shout out if you're here live or on the replay and um we're talking about 10 different Trends we've spotted and I'll recap them in a bit and I've got five that I'm sharing myself in part two these are some things we've been testing and that you can test as well so as you're watching this video or you are just jumping on and you watch the replay um there's some big changes on YouTube so tapping into some of these Trends is a good way if maybe you're plateaued not getting views right now how can you reinvent your content maybe try something new and so with that yeah let's hit the next Point um in your deck here I forhad outed storytelling and we'll come back to that see a number of comments but let's quickly dive into thumbnails and the thumbnails that are working it's been very interesting year because we kind of seen some things that's actually I think beneficial to a beginner and that's like people are wanting authentic real thumbnails it's quite interesting so we've done a number of tests I've stole tekashi slides here so forgive me but he has a great demonstration he's been a testing different thumbnails that we've noticed that's working for us so here's a side by-side demonstration you know this side is like extremely cluttered a lot of text you know and then it's a you know perfect background like it's different colors bright so people you know people are trying to create those thumbnails to get people's click but what we found is that there's a more clean style that people are actually really engaging with so we've done a number of ab tests and for one video we come up with three different thumbnails and time and time again a simple clean photo is working simple clean photo of a camera no text you know this is probably more minimal of alab doll this went straight up no text just Sean and what's interesting is you know we're got great thumbnail designers on our team and so we're diving into this but we're noticing that people like the authentic in 2024 like people want a realistic photo or a thumbnail and I think that's just comes from like we're constantly tricked we're not sure what to believe and if you see a thumbnail that's just really open and just sincere like you can see your background I think it does say something fundamentally one thing that um Dave altiser he was touching touching on thumbnails he was talking about Simply Having like the same clothes as you are wearing the video is enough to like that little thing can be enough to just reinforce to the audience like hey you know this is a legitimate video like you're wearing that same piece you're being authentic um it's just a better representation of your video If we go back to the movie example right you know if videos are like movies our thumbnails should be like posters right you want a poster that's actually going to be true to what the movie is going to be but also you want it to look nice you know you want to be sharp you want to be interesting and engaging but we're finding that there's definitely been a shift towards if we're on a pendulum at least we're shifting towards more authentic so I think the key takea away from this is if you have a great title and idea strong basic clean and authentic thumbnail will actually work so what does this mean for viewers I think it simply means like if you're doing a talking head video as if you know I was talking to camera I think that means you don't necessarily have to have like cut yourself out and have a super clean background you could leave it kind of like as your background and then just do some simple text to reinforce your video that's something we've seen Al AB doll just really hone in on and it's working well um so yeah it's like little things like that have been just key to be more like if you're thinking about a Creator and a viewer it does make sense to Showcase what we're actually watching so again time and time again we're seeing on our homepage you can look through our Channel you might start seeing some cleaner more minimal photos sometimes just shine an interesting expression you know very subdued expression but that's sometimes enough to create that Intrigue um we're going to dive into storytelling but Sean do you have any kind of thoughts on this era of having simpler less Desy thumbnails yeah I think I think there's a couple things that's interesting um you know later on we'll talk a little bit how we are in the authenticity Revolution meaning people are just kind of burnt out on certain things like so they just get burnt out on maybe overpromises or overly hyped things and so a lot of times the the trends that happen on YouTube and almost in anything are pendulum swings I mean there's Trends in fashion right now the genes go from skinnier to baggier and then back to skinnier and so it was all skinny jeans paint on jeans now it's like bell bottoms and like fullon skater baggy jeans are back this is a fact and I'm here for it you know as a 90s kid uh you know skateboarding birdhouse baggy jeans what's the point so sometimes maybe certain thumbnail styles working in a season and a lot of times knowing when the timing is to sort of do the opposite so I think that minimalist and simple thumbnails are working because of it kind of just being the opposite of what we've seen and also um just being sometimes different we're trying to stop the scroll so when you maybe have seen you know it's a pattern interrupt as well like how do you do a pattern interrupt if you're used to seeing the same thing over and over we develop what's called ad blindness it's like if there's banner ads in your email inbox box or something like that you see them at first and they maybe used to work but now you just don't even notice them you just even your brain kind of rewires so we're always thinking about as creatives and as YouTube creators just kind of what's Happening next and what's where's the pendulum swinging next but I think it's also about testing and experimenting I know for some um maybe sometimes typically female channels might have we we always say have simplistic text but they might have more cursive emotional fonts wow I'm going to get slaughtered in the comments uh you know maybe more collage of like a day in the life and that like really works and so you always have to know what's happening in your Niche um and that still might be working there so I think kind of studying your Niche but these are some broad Trends in terms of what we're seeing in thumbnails and I'm curious what people's experience is as well before I bury myself let me kick it back to you Nate for this next point that you got well I think you brought up a good point about you youve often said many times different is better than better and I noticed scrolling on my YouTube TV you know I'm I saw half of Sean's shoulder and just because it was like so different like it made me scroll over oh yeah like you know I edited that video but it was enough to eye catch me you know and it was so different than all the other noise out there so instead of just simply thinking about making good thumbnail what's a way you can stand out so go type in the video you're making on YouTube and see what thumbnails people are making how can you make yours stand out so that's a simple and easy tip we do have a question I thought I completely replace the other one I'm sorry but uh I thought this was interesting is it worth uploading two thumbnails to test and I think here on think media that's what we are doing we're uploading three different thumbnails every time we upload and I think we're in the season of just capturing data right so we want to see okay what does work YouTube's given us the tools to see okay well we noticed the simple train that's how we were able to find out that trend of cleaner thumbnails because we could actually see that data was backing that so oftentimes you know I might have a preference of a thumbnail oh I want it this way someone else might have it this way but it's nice to have cold hard data to show you what's working and what can you derive from so I think yeah and I think not only if you can if you can utilize the test and compare thumbnail split test from YouTube you should and what you're seeing here is one we're running on yesterday's video on um this new trend is taking over vlogging now definitely tapping into Trend surfing and influence Surfing by having um you know different known people in the thumbnail but one thing to note is it's not just about click-through rate what it's ultimately about is and if you hover over this the winning thumbnail is generated by the highest share of the video's watch time so great thumbnails don't just get people to click they help the viewer or understand what the video is about so that they can make informed decisions about what to watch by selecting based on watch time share the winning thumbnail is the one that gets viewers to both click and stay and so the big key here is that um we're not just trying to get thumbnails only to like shock somebody or like well that's a little different so they click on it and then they get there and they're like okay cool that was different but I'm not going to stay or or we maybe clickbait and what people thought it was going to be it ends up not being that well if it doesn't lead to watch time It ultimately is not going to be the winning thumbnail on YouTube YouTube's eyes so I think it's thinking through the fact that title thumbnail um topic all work together in terms of packaging but even if you're click through rate someone asked earlier actually um and maybe in a different place like what would you uh it was on it was on the community tab by the way if you have a question that doesn't get answered today I have a post out I'm doing my next batch of our new series on the take media Community Tab and you could always post your question over there um and someone asked what would you choose CTR or avd click-through rate or average viation I I would choose average viation but it's kind of both like I would take a lower clickthrough rate with more average view duration rather than a higher clickthrough rate and no average view duration because minutes matter most on YouTube It's Time on platform that matters most and so anyways if you see this post on the think media Community tab um this is is where I'm capturing questions that I'll be turning into videos and shout out to uh 131 responses already but if you have a deep dive question and context one of the things I asked for was um up voting other people's questions a but also add details because it's one thing to be like how do I get more views I'm actually I'm probably not gonna answer that question because it's like well we have videos on the channel about it but if it's like how do I get views on my crochet channel that I've been doing for four years that I only have five hours week to do like if you give me some context then we could get into some interesting um content so anyways that's on the community tab we're talking about thumbnails back to you absolutely one last note about thumbnails I'll just point out we recently had a video and it was underperforming you know we had we were trying everything we could but people just weren't interested in it or just maybe the thumbnail wasn't clear enough and so you know we talked we workshopped it let's come up with a new thumbnail concept see if we can revive this video and totally different concept I think we kept um we might have changed title as well which is important to note in this equation but once we did the just the thumbnail swap we got it went from 33% average view duration to 66% average view view duration um which is huge that's like twice as people watching just based off a thumbnail so that can be another thing you're it takes a lot of effort to make a video takes a little bit less effort to make a thumbnail still a lot but if you can spend a little extra time to best create a poster for your video I think it's worth doing that and who knows a simple thumbnail swap might be key for you to get a lot more views and keep growing your Channel all right so we're gonna dive into next um we're going to talk about storytelling I brought it up earlier but this was a key thing that I kept hearing um over and over again I know a lot of you have comments about how do I apply storytelling well here's is a few things to keep in mind um again making your viewer feel can you spark empathy you know can you invoke curiosity maybe it's awe or you're cultivating hope tapping into Nostalgia these are a few different ways we can kind of just we can add a whole another flavor to our video if we just think about tapping into people's emotions so since many of us are educational people have problems they want to solve so perhaps you can spark empathy with that moment you know rather than being a know-it-all and be like oh you're an idiot do it this way you know sympathize with them and be like okay I remember what it's like to begin to edit a video I didn't know everything I want to be able to follow along and uh feel like I'm not being traded like an idiot but I'm learning and growing so having a positive attitude I think you can make people feel by tapping in being in the shoes is a huge thing I think a lot of us can start do um especially if you're creating like a hook right if you can identify a problem people are more likely to assume that you have a solution which is a very interesting kind of psychological thing um building curiosity there's a lot of great channels that are really tapping into this there's a YouTube channel called Preston goes and I watched a few of his videos he made a silly video about just like he built a railroad train track and he put it on a set of abandoned tracks and he wanted to go all the way across but he made that video feel so emotional because you get to see him pour His effort into making a cart and he's telling stories about how you know he's always wanted to do this or for whatever reason showing the hurdles obstacles he's gone through those are things that we all sympath like have experienced is you face an obstacle how are you going to avoid it how can you get over that and seeing people do it and achieve their goal we all celebrate in that so think about a few ways you know screenshot this if you want a few ways how you could tap into creating that so Sean is pulling up Preston goes I believe this is not Preston but Preston goes yeah he it's super interesting um definitely check out this channel if you want to learn storytelling um for your videos again who's looking up I built an underground go-kart not a lot of people but once you're familiar with him and you watch his videos like you're entertained because he's just telling stories and you might be asking yourself okay how do you put storytelling in a simple video well I think there's a lot of stories that we kind of discredit we don't think they're like we're not talking about Hamlet we're not talking about Shakespeare we're just talking about little Stories We would tell our friends and family so if I were you know let's just take a example here A buddy of mine wanted to learn video editing right actually I'll tell you this here's a real story my sister was trying to learn video editing and she said she was looking up resolve tutorials and she's like is there any good resources for editing because I've already made a video that's pretty in depth that shows a beginner from start to finish you know I was just able to send over that link and be like boom here you go like simple as that like I was in that moment where I've already done all the hard work I could just send a link and it felt genuinely good to be like oh you know I've help someone someone close to me and they are able to go the extra mile um and I didn't really have to do anything in that moment because I already done it at the beginning so that's a cool thing that we can have on our YouTube channels like the better you can help someone else like you don't feel bad about like helping people right so I think that's just like so key is learning those little anecdotes how can you apply those to your videos that make sense you don't want to go off tangents right but I think people long for that personal connection and the greatest way to that is telling simple stories Sean you're a storytelling expert do you have any tips for that well um you know I actually would dive into this question to kind of also talk about sort of two different types of content I think that Grace uh with the grid asks since Preston creates content out of the norm does he still need to focus on the description and tags as much you know in a case like Preston's Channel you in a way almost don't need to focus on the description of the tags at all because these are browse which is a traffic Source on YouTube algorithm hacking type of videos meant to they're a little bit longer entertainment can be suggested on TVs but all devices um and really we maybe talk about two big buckets of content there's suggested content and there's search based content so Grace and grit you know some types of channels it's knowing also not it doesn't always broadly fit into just entertainment and education but a lot of times it can as well so what's here's like an interesting illustration is you've got you know Preston over here with like my RC submarine explores a sunken aircraft carrier which is a 25 minute video that is like a masterpiece of editing and footage and thumbnail and packaging and retention and uh it got 1.8 million views we could also look at like we could go Microsoft word tutorial and entertainment versus education this video got the same amount of views as Preston 1.7 million views and uh the budget on this one's a little bit lower you know like this individual is not even on camera um they're just recording their screen they walk through a screen share now good education time codes chapters breaking it down so I think it's just knowing that YouTube is a diverse place and it depends on what you're trying to achieve and while this is also going to get an incredible amount of watch time because someone who watches this it's a complete course is going to click on this for the desire to learn this probably watch until the end and there's a lot of watch time as well speaks to viewer intent but I think more so title description and tags when someone is actively searching for something because a lot of the entertainment stuff Nate right like people don't know to search for these outlandish creative ideas that Mr Beast or Ryan tryan or pressor doing what what's actually happening it's algorithmic based it's like I'm just looking for something to watch whoa like I didn't know this jetpack was gonna work so good like you know like I might like jetpack it's a totally different approach to YouTube it's the it's the Brows suggested approach and there's also the search based approach and I think the the savest creators understand both methods tap into both methods and then choose which method they want to use depending on the video they're creating and so um it's really yeah it's not one or other being better it's really about different yeah absolutely and I going back down like being very practical something that I'm trying to actively solve for is like when should I find little bits of interjecting my humor into a video even if it is a camera tutorial I think people still like to have people like humor people like to laugh people like to hear stories um finding those moments where you can you know it's a attention resetter right so I think that is a great way is just incorporating more of your humor yourself into the video you know we're all very unique characters and so if we have our like own sitcom or whatnot you know find ways that make your character a little bit more unique versus just simply giving information I think that's there can only be one of you on YouTube so trying to better understand what makes you you is going to help your audience like naturally gravitate towards you you're not going to attract everyone but you will attract those and they will you know Bond and really dive in deep we got one more slide here where we're talking about um just more storytelling establishing a relatable character building suspense and tension I think a lot of times you know what's a certain tension people have or suspense like you are trying to solve a problem you do it one way like if Preston ising this cart and it fails miserably there's certain emotions that come with that and again unexpected plot twist like these are all things we can um inject into our videos but I'll really just boil it down to obstacles coming over those um knowing what the viewer is going through but fundamentally it's like we're not trying to create fake emotions like what are authentic emotions that are relevant in your video so like I'm not trying to Mr beastify you know like a YouTube tutorial right I'm trying to really just understand and what's its proper context so those all all those different elements is going to help people like that's just another method if you are beginning like this might seem way more advanced and to be honest like I haven't done all of these myself either but these are different trends that we've seen on YouTube like a lot of filmmakers are bringing like a slower Pace to YouTube um and Vlogs is the same way it's like it's a slower more intentional U letting you feel those emotions but if I had to like summarize the key to success for YouTube in 2024 Beyond number one focus on your viewer can you understand what they're going through what their interests are and just get a better picture a number when I was at vid Summit the number of creators that create their own channel avatars you know um they would create these personas of what their ideal viewer is what's their age what are their interest you know do they go to college or are they full-time um are they a mom are they a parent like the better you can understand your viewer you can start making content that they're going to be interested in I think we often limit ourselves onto the content we think people are interested just because we had one video do extremely well if I did an editing video and that's all I did you know there's a certain Niche for that but after a while you might feel like you want to expand different topics there's a good chance that they're are interested in those things and there's different ways you can smoothly transition and identify what our Niche is which if you want to dive into that we have different resources you can check out um but again I'll go back to the other success create a repeatable long form format again what's something you can consistently do on a basis that is longer form because people want to get to know you it's hard to get to know someone on a YouTube short because they 30 to 60 seconds or now 3 minutes but you can get to really know someone in an hourong video now I'm don't necessarily recommend starting out with an hourong video but if you are doing podcasts like can you create an intentionally video that's packed full value and should be that long you know don't waste people's time but if you can go deeper dive in more different aspects of that problem you're trying to solve that's all helpful again tell stories tell compelling stories they don't have to be great things but different things you've went through or hey I had this problem this is how I overcame it let me show you how to do that and then lastly focus on videos that are actively growing your audience um this is one piece of advice they gave is there's if you uploaded any number of videos there's probably good chance you could see where people were interested in right unless you have like zero views then we got to try something else but if you are if you have one video that did 100 views and the rest did 25 what's about that one that got 100 views and learning to not just necessarily repeat the video but follow up make a part two what's a video that can accompany that so those are all different ways that is going to help you create better videos in 2024 and ultimately get you more views so that way grow your channel um but yeah that's pretty much my recap of what we learned in bid Summit Sean do you have any ahas or takeaways well I want to get into those and in just a second I actually want to share five trends that I've spotted and we're noticing at think media as well if you're just jumping on definitely watch the replay because Nate just broke down really some powerful insights in terms of some of the things working on YouTube right now for getting views and how to make better content and so uh much more to come and um before we dive into kind of part two of the video if you're getting value it always means the world to us and the YouTube algorithm if you smash like and today's stream is brought to you by vid iq.com slink you can get a 30-day trial of vid iq's boost plan for just $1 and I asked you earlier when people were just jumping on the stream what niches are you in and one crafty gal said resin art is the niche that they are in and I actually want to show show you one cool tool here with vid IQ called outliers and so the big idea of what an outlier is is a video that is outperforming all the other videos on an individual's Channel and what's kind of cool about this tool is you could type in something like resin art which is one crafty gal's Niche here and we can look at now and see okay on these different channels this one right here was a 100x outlier that means that this particular video got a 100 times more views than the channels videos typically get and perhap perhaps you go oh wow I was just about to do a particular epoxy res table or something or maybe something not with seashells but that's similar even the way the title structured what can we learn about the thumbnails in almost every case there's no text on the thumbnails they're they're bright clear um pleasing images of what it is turning a free wasp nest into expensive art resinart there that's a 10x outlier and what you can actually do here is you can filter down to say okay I actually only only want to see channels that let's say have under 50,000 subscribers or something like it's one thing for a big channel to get a lot of views but maybe some smaller channels this channel has 5,700 subscribers and they got 82,000 views and 90 5x outlier here still getting 3.5 views per hour meaning this video still gets 3.5 views 24 hours a day 365 days a year and at three years old um and so that's a resent art sphere so you may be like different ways that again Inspire your next video and as we're talking about Trends and what's working on YouTube right now this is kind of one of the biggest Trends is this idea of being able to B what's happening jump on it quickly with your own version you it's not about copying somebody else but it's about drafting behind videos that are getting view velocity um it's one of the best thing ways to get views and grow your channel so that's just one of the many Suite of tools that vid IQ has if you've never tried it out the generate tool is pretty impressive it's pretty crazy you've got uh the keyword uh research tool still one of my favorites and ability to analyze competitors and stuff like that so if you want to try it out it's just $1 you could head to vid iq.com slink or you can um click the link in the description down below now I've got a couple quick Trends I'll have Nate back to commentate with me on some of these and um we talked about in the first part about algorithm updates we talked about um Trends and thumbnails we talked about long form and short form um we've been covering in 10 viral video Trends you need to try here's a couple more um the rise of the niche appearence Creator it's like Niche experience Creator try to be creative there this is basically creators that are finding success by combining their unique life experience with specific Niche interests now as a YouTube educator one thing I've noticed and I don't know if you've seen this there's this massive trend on like why people over 40 must start a YouTube channel and Rob the maritim up in Canada has kind of like led the wave as far as I could tell but a lot of others Kevin col's a good friend um he jumped on that you see multiple channels jumping on it but what are we talking about you know in any given Niche you might feel like it's so competitive you know well finding ways to Niche down is a great way to stand out and not only that I think there's also a couple things that we're seeing here this is the over 40 YouTube Boom um it's also this idea of the of the experienced YouTuber um and you're also tapping into a trend of like there's a real Community here that's that's it's resonating with for a long time YouTube is seen as the domain of younger creators so this trend recognizes there's a huge audience of people over 40 who are interested in content created um in this particular Niche so what else could this apply to well you know Andrew uh Bustamante if I'm saying his last name right you know not all of us are excia agents like he is but I mean he is an ex CIA agent he specializes in spy skills so he's taking his experience and then tying it into here's this promise I will teach you the same awesome spy skills I learned in this CIA so you can make more money get better health and live an amazing life on your own terms so this kind of like rise of the niche experience content creator like another example could be if you were like a retired teacher explaining Tech or making Tech simple the experience is retired teachers who have a knack for explaining things clearly the niche is maybe you're targeting older adults who struggle to keep up with technology so you know kind of the tone and the pacing and the storytelling you want to do and then an example could be Tech tips with Mr Jones uh you could offer tutorials using smartphone social media online services and you're taking your experience by the way this is why creaters over 40 50 60 of all ages or maybe gen Z that have spent a couple years in a particular world every the world you've been immersed in if you like shine some light on that and creatively package that people from all around the world want to hear from you learn from you so I think this is an interesting Trend that I'm seeing Nate have you noticed that in any particular areas and I'm curious I bet your algorithm wasn't hit with over 40 which speaks to the fact maybe it was but you can tell me in a second it speaks to the fact that all of our homepages are different everybody's homepage is different everybody's algorithm is different so there's this massive opportunity when you understand how the YouTube algorithm Works to be creating content that resonates with a certain demo right your your algorithm I'm sure there's probably some overlap in the fact that we both like are logged into our think media account so it's probably mixed yeah I I search up think media every day so my algorithm is probably skewed but uh I believe that one example why you should start a YouTube channel over 40 I think it was like someone film making related so like I saw that pop up but it is interesting and I it's so interesting that there's so many opportunities to start a YouTube channel and not many people just beyond you know getting subscribers getting views so those are just different angles right that people can tap into what is people's unique selling points that they've lived their whole life that's one advantage like I started YouTube when I was really young so like I didn't have experience or profis I was just kind of learning as I was going but someone comes and they live their life right they have all these skill sets all these stories that they can tell in their videos so I think that's one great way to just hop on the train and really help influence people I love it I got a couple more here uh and these kind of Stack so identity-driven titles so these are like titles of your video that appeal to a spe a specific identity so look at this um kind of TAPS into the over 40 YouTubers but look at these titles I'm 40 if you're in your 20s watch this I'm 44 if you're in your 20s watch this I'm 57 if you're in your 40s watch this these videos got millions of views which a point to make here too is at the beginning of this entire training we talked about like 10 viral Trends one of the things we talk about in our program in fact Kelly signed up recently congrats for jumping in our VR program in V we talk about this term vfm which is viral for me because if you're typically getting 30 views and then you get 3,000 that would be viral for me right and then you start compounding that success well when you spot a trend like this it's not so much that you're G to get 3.3 million views but it's it's that if you potentially draft on the trend you maybe typically get 300 views and you might get 33,00 which would I know that's not viral by like technical terms but it's definitely viral for me if that's your typical terms so you could kind of call this um you know identity specific titles you're calling out a person and these are not learning as much search based although they kind of tap into search because sometimes people do look for advice and they are 20 or whatever um this's another term for this would be like hyper targeted titles here's another one um if you're still single and want a girl girlfriend watch this video I'm going have to save that video later yes uh so this is kind of again you're typing into an identity a you're you're calling out singles you're calling out a desire and there's putting some mystery in there the way he even added text to the thumbnails powerful the Simplicity we're seeing kind of the stoic anti- YouTuber face thumbnail Trend a lot of combination of things happening here and you could call this also the niche appeal strategy because it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be age it could be relational status it could be uh career status you're just calling people out it's also relatability marketing it captures the core core goal of making viewers feel seen and understood that one hits like that slaps hard if you're like yeah I am single and I want a girlfriend and you know I need to watch that video and so if you're scrolling boom that hits you the YouTube algorithm is like Word of Mouth digitally so it could really get shared Nate how could other I mean how what does this inspire in terms of creativity that creators watching this could apply you know I didn't even really think about this but when you brought up that example it's like I may not have watched a video from them because okay maybe they're not my age demographic but seeing that positioning how they had it suddenly that now attracts a viewer like me so it's like you could attract a whole different Audience by just phrasing it now it's Sol in its position to where I can learn from them I can learn from people who have experienced those things so I think that opens up other opportunities to be like okay maybe how could we target people who want to start a YouTube channel in their 50s and their 60s I saw a YouTube channel this Grandma started Channel and she was in her 90s and she was just uploading day after day multiple times a day she learned how to do it she was do it for fun now she has like 50 something thousand subscribers so those are all super cool um very smart ways to again you're calling out a very specific person and yeah like those those videos attract me even though I wasn't particularly interested in them beforehand and I think it as these continue to stack this is kind of similar but these are also distinct uh another one here would be personalized clickbait so this is kind of acknowledging an attention grabbing element calling out perhaps a specific identity but this might be surprising to some people so I've been seeing videos like this this video will find you right when you need to hear this which is like kind of a crazy title but some of these videos can get hundreds of thousands of millions of views so you're you're relying on pure algorithmic recommendations because you don't even know I don't even know what she's talking about like what do I need to hear and but this video is a 4.8x outlier for her it's getting two views per hour it's spreading in the YouTube algorithm and perhaps probably there is is um I think her photo uh in thumbnail is maybe somebody that resonates with the way she looks maybe that is looking for I'm just speculating here but it's maybe kind of like a girlfriend to connect with talk about advice process issues whatever you're going through now there's another video here right this video will make you see everything in green color again we're talking about this idea on this trend of personalized clickbait like and this idea of saying you like this video will make you see everything in the color green more for the person who's perhaps just opening YouTube Not In Search of answering a specific question or solving a certain problem but just kind of scrolling and looking for something to call out to them this CH Channel rainbow egg is kind of more almost like game gamification type of videos like there's videos that are like quiz kind of quizzes or kind of interactive in a way even though they're not interactive like it's gonna going to trigger something that's kind of entertainment you're just kind of looking for but the way that you're positioning these are baiting The Click by personally calling out a viewer and so uh the next one is the authenticity Revolution this has been said talked about quite a bit I think it's important to notice and this ties all the way back to earlier on the video Nate you were breaking down we're doing split test with three different thumbnails and the most overdesigned with the most text and logos and things on them aren't performing as well as just some of the most M minimalized ones minimalist ones and so for example here's a ve again a uh not an exaggerated face kind of almost a slightly somewhat maybe discouraged or questioning or pensive face title when things just don't work out open loop right there Curiosity and so if you're watching this and you're thinking about you know of course the point with authenticity is not to make it a iick it but it's to do it authentically it's sort of funny that people would try to game authenticity but like titles could be like my biggest insecurity dot dot dot um I failed or things didn't go as planned real talk about insert the topic uh Day in the Life the unedited version responding to your assumptions about me uh what I wish I knew when I was younger so this also perhaps going to help when you have any number of subscribers but if they followed you for a while and they're used to seeing a certain thing from you if I upload a video responding to your assumptions about me it's a great title like I'm ready like what are your assumptions about me tell me in the chat or in the comments I'll make a video or like real talk about and insert maybe taboo topic or something bottom line is we're in the authenticity Revolution and I think the reason people are doing this is this is that pendulum swing away from people maybe feeling burnt out by overpromise is overhype some people call it the uh the era of excess on YouTube and the Mr beastify of YouTube where everything's just so extreme and exaggerated and and truly unrealistic unrelatable and entertaining to a degree Mr BEAST's got quite a bit of smoke around him right now and the whole thing but ultimately vulnerability embracing your imperfections people so much they relate with this type of stuff I've got I'm curious your thoughts n in a second but you know Vanessa salow did uh disappeared for a while and then came back and made a video why I quit I built a seven figure crater business and I quit here's why is kind of that open loop of vulnerability and she got very real in that video I watched uh a good a portion of that video because I was curious and and looking for that more like don't just tell me about your successes tell me about your struggle don't just tell me about the wins or the tactics tell me about the real and the raw the mess marriage is Hard YouTube is hard health challenges what's going on mental health challenges what are things the pressure of all this stuff so we're definitely in that authenticity Revolution um and I think people are tired of fake Perfection right and people are are Tire if it's relatable and so you don't always just have to I I think the cool thing here is alleviate the pressure of having to like always just show success or like how great you are at something you can get a lot of viewers for the fact that you failed at something like doing a cha Challenge and by challenge I mean for 30 days I tried a new routine or I tried to whatever and you didn't succeed but the storytelling of that throw back to Nate's earlier points like a travel vlogger documenting a trip that goes wrong or musici showing behind the scenes of a recording session that was terrible or um you know talking about online hate hate or auty YouTuber talking about struggles with acne and different things people want that real and that raw Nate what do you think about this authenticity Revolution absolutely what I think draws my eye to those thumbnails is like people do like to catch on to human faces so you're immediately like eyes attracted to their eyes then you read the title find out what it is but there is something to be said about that neutral expression this is something that like most skilled actors in Hollywood do is sometimes when you think there's a beautiful performance it's just very minimal because what are you what's the actor doing the person viewing is projecting themselves onto that person and so when you see a title like that you know I quit a seven figure business and that you see their expression but you don't give a lot of details suddenly you now have this curiosity Gap where you're feeding your own projections onto that so you want to click to see if that's true or not so I think that's like little Keys like instead of going a shock face you know all the time try to learn to subdue that again very technical thing but again it's just being more you don't have to be crazy about everything I think that's what we really learned in this vlogging era is like people at the end of the day want to connect with other humans and watch what they do um people want to watch people like them you know I oddly enough like my parents have been watching YouTube on the TV and we'll just watch like people mowing their video like mowing the Lawns right and they do it for free they mow people people Lawns and I'm just like I don't get this at all but there's something to be said about that because the way they um their personality is their certain beliefs that they have their being charitable like all that they're not fantastic content whatsoever you could argue how valuable they are but people watch them and that's that's really interesting so it's great insights okay a couple more this might be my last one but we'll see what we got here so the next one is search optimize driven vlogging and I just did a bit a video with my friend Benji Travis co-author of our book YouTube secrets and we're talking about this trend is taking over vlogging of course some people are saying they're like this trend has always been around and I would say well I mean perhaps but I think what's the big idea here is like sometimes in vlogging people think that the the original Trend was like daily Vlogs and the idea was like it had to be your whole day and thus it started with like you brushing your teeth and ended with you going to bed at night and it sort of you know also was more about the personality where a way to articulate this is it could be about something that people are searching for or a Micro Niche or micro community and there's actual value in it but it's in a vlog style and so we'll link to that video in the description and I'll um if you haven't watched it but Benji's been crushing it on his channel and some of his most viewed videos now we're going to kind of layer strategies is he is driving to he is thinking because of mastering YouTube and the algorithm a lot of times he's planning out his video like on the drive to a location so he's actually thinking though and he's he's going into it not just with the randomness of a vlog but like what's the angle what's the big idea what's the title gonna be what's the thumbnail gonna be and kind of just planning in his head and then he gets there DJI osmo pocket 3 boom hooks in the beginning Vlogs throughout it simple editing pretty basic but if you see this video 5 48,000 views 19 minutes authenticity Revolution because it's not overly edited and polish but minimal edits it's kind of a linear story but it's also does it's not starting it's not a daily Vlog it is a search optimized value driven Vlog right and so what's also interesting is some of his most viewed videos lately have been related to Costco how is Costco different in Japan which this would be two things here hyper Niche domination a very specific Niche like Costco is a niche within a niche it's it's a niche within shopping or retail people love seeing different stores but also micro Community Building Costco enthusiasts are crazy like and people who love micro communities either one you don't watch any Costco videos or two if you do you watch tons of Costco videos that's an interesting thought about YouTube is like when you get into a hyper niche like for me as a Christian and Faith you know person of faith not only is my faith something I take so seriously but I just it's not like I go kind of deep I mean I will I go deep and continuous into that culture because I love studying the Bible I love learning about it listening to different things about it different conversations theology different thing like so like it sort of speaks to the fact that you can like endlessly go deep and why faith and theology is deeper than Costco Costco is close for some people I mean and it's like when you C's always it's a whole fashion culture I mean who here is like Kirkland from head to toe is you know it's a whole it is a subculture Disney is another one like there's micro communities like these subcultures and you can kind of layer on that Vlog style that relational style and I think another key to that is you're doing something that also you would do anyways because Benji is the ultimate food geek loves food loves to cook food wants to talk about food all day and I'm here for it because I like to eat his food uh he makes the best stuff ever go over to his house we live about five minutes apart from each other and like and so he can just kind of freestyle in such a way you definitely know your YouTube channel is about something great if you're freestyling about it can Captivate somebody else's attention for 29 minutes because you're like oh wow I didn't even thought about that oh I didn't even know about the ingredients and oh I hadn't even thought about your perspective so anyways this would be search-based value driven Vlogs and then this idea of like even going deeper the keyword of Costco and the search based around there better than Costco us food chef store so anyways if you haven't watched this video the new vlogging style is taking over for more on that that's in the description down below and it'll probably be the end card at the end of the video um of this one but those are a few more Trends we I think we probably covered more than 10 but we'll do our best to time code in chapter roughly the 10 sections of this video and we could hit a couple questions uh Nate what do you think about kind of this how vlogging is evolved in the way you've seen yeah I was you know having seen like The Inspirations like Casey neist early on like this height of the vlogging era like yeah I watched them a bunch and it's interesting to see you know there's nothing new Under the Sun right like people still want to be they want the solution to their problem right and so what Benji's done really well is like he has found a niche where he can kind of be a Sandbox you know he's not being distracted about these other things but he's really fulfilling on that audience that wants to watch Costco videos and within that box there's a whole world he can be in right so he can talk about these different aspects and finding ways to make those interesting is super interesting one of the key takeaways from that video was the fact that not only he's not trying to be the best Costco video he's trying to be the second best so when you watch the first best his video appears on the side and that's really interesting is YouTube is so vast that you not only are serving those people but the people who want to go deep ER and so I think this just so interesting um I did a video on my channel it was about film making advice I took inspiration when we compiled a uh best YouTube advice for 30 minutes and I'm like I wonder if there's a film making one and to my surprise there wasn't any film making advice compilation that was that long or that ad depth there was a few here and there but there's no video about film making of device of that length and of that stature and I uploaded this is a follow-up to that video and like it's 10,000 views in a a week you know and the first video got 400,000 views and it still shocks me that there's still these other areas of YouTube that are untapped niches you have to find them like it it's it's hard and difficult to sometimes find those things but you're just like one idea away from like making a video that's not on YouTube and that's really cool even in 2024 where people think it's too late there's still all these untapped niches niches within the niches so that would be my encouragement to people is you know if they're want to try something new or they're trying to you know play with things maybe it is taking the vlogging format maybe it is a podcast format but you can bring it to a specific Niche or specific topic yeah you know Ty tying back into earlier when when someone asked what does um repeatable mean when we talk about long form repeatable that's what's kind of cool about this specifically new style of vlogging that Benji's doing he's able to pump out an insane amount of content because of the format because of also it's a whole workflow it's figuring out the right tool DJI osmo pocket 3 you got of think about workflow the idea of having the right tool workflow of I'm gonna film what happens next download the footage edit how do I do the thumbnail make sure to get a picture of the thumbnail and then also though that you could be less interested I mean by the way you just we did another one 10 days ago why toilet paper sold out at Costco Costco makes it in the title and it's like that's gonna be a banger right like it just pops off but that's I mean as we process this Benji has five daughters what are we talking about like so you also think I know people uh are how do I do business uh YouTube with a fulltime job how do I do YouTube and of course he's fulltime and he's got brand deals and they have more momentum and him and Judy like his wife also has a vlog Channel but listen it's not about your resources it's about your resourcefulness and about finding content formats if possible that are sustainable repeatable um and a lot of these factors are actually you don't it's not that you have to start this new style of vlogging there's a lot of different ways you can apply this stuff but a lot of this I mean this is the new style of vlogging this is the authenticity re Revolution this is the Simplicity in thumbnails there 's a lot of common Trends so if you stack what we just talked about in this video you know and you think about which of these Trends can I kind of pull into myons and I really believe there's a ton of views waiting for you on the other side all right I'm gonna share maybe a few final things I wanted to hit one thing just because it is October 15 and today was the day that shorts were supposed to work three minute shorts we did a survey and most people have not tried some people have tried and they did not work as far as three minutes being suggested in the short Shelf but Cameron caught that Creator Lee aison said you can upload them right now but they won't appear as a short until later this week so YouTube appears to not be ready yet that's from Creator liaison who said that so if you're uploading three minutes shorts today trying to hop on that Trend because that's a brand new uh time limit increase that YouTube has updated it looks like later this week they will start making it to the shorts shelf and so for people one ing um yes Michael they're just not working yet but if you upload them now maybe they'll just click over at the end of the week and who knows maybe we have a viral short because YouTube's testing out the new length Nate any final thoughts on the trends today I want to hit one or two more questions myself and then I we'll land the plane but uh yeah give us your takeaway for those that want more views want to grow their channels um yeah I think if my takeaway what I would start implementing today is yeah just authentic thumb Nails uh because I think it's easy for a beginner right instead of worrying how to try to craft a thumbnail just really understand what the viewer is wanting and take a simple like if you're doing a a food cooking show just show a picture of the dish don't show this crazy you know everything else just be really authentic and I think it's an easy way to go about it maybe a little bit of text here and there but um and then find a way for your thumbnail to be different right I think that's why we're seeing this pendulum is is because the authentic is standing out right and it may not stand out forever but I don't see that ever going out of phase either because it's been around for so long and it's just now kind of people like that but that would be my my key takeaway is just learning to be a little bit more authentic with the thumbnail because I think that's going to get people to be better like more relatable and we'll actually click and watch your video you know I I'm really glad you brought that up and and you brought this up and Kyle was telling me about how you were talking about this I think that we could just go a little bit deeper exactly what Nate means if we go into Cana here I think a trend that can happen is um what people would maybe do in the past is uh let me adjust the image and auto adjust and get my little brightness on my photo so here's a photo that I took right in my office here holding a camera um put the timer on shot a thumbnail now what people would do is they'd go background remover and in the past they would then have this cutout image use something like canva Photoshop and whatever and then have this like designed looking thumbnail and I think if what you're talking about though is you're saying that um really the authentic thumbnail could be like leave the The Reel in there so I'm I don't shouldn't have changed the image up but let me let me change it up here I'll go back to the first one let me go to my new my hands open one I have that one here okay so instead of just cutting you out and then having the smoke and the black background or whatever the big idea could be that you simply actually leave the background right and so if we go edit and we go adjust auto adjust and then we go copy paste and I'm going to copy paste the image twice so that the background is still there and then what I might do because you could just leave the image as it is but what I might do here just for my own edits is take the background and then make the brightness a little bit less uh maybe kind of pull the highlights down and perhaps even take something like um a an element and and maybe make a a a could maybe make this like a yellow and then take the opacity of it and bring down that transparency and and you might what do you think even that might be too much I'm going to go a lot darker than that but maybe I just want to give a little bit of tint to the background so now I'm still in my real office but to your point like you also could head over to dolly or something and give yourself an AI background uh and there's something about as like Dave Mae uh would talk about that it's powerful to have um you know the same clothes and maybe the real office that you're in so if it's a fake background but if you were to say um you know simple home office background you also could bottom line articulate what you kind of mean here because I think yeah yeah I think we can get so caught up and we told to make our thumbnails the importance of the thumbnail people now know that which is great but we I feel like sometimes you if you don't have a lot of professional skill like you end up going down this road that you know it's maybe it's making your thumbnail actually worse so what for me at least my like my skill set it's like I could actually just take a good photo and then not have to worry about designing anything I just like okay make sure you open your window get good lighting but I think even this right like this is a little bit more authentic right it's less of that design background um I'm not saying the it's worse you know you don't it's not like it a s that you're doing it this way you know but I think I would try that like if you are working on designing using canva like I use canva but if you could just experiment and take a step away and like okay let me just take a photo of in my room and do an AB test just see what does better because maybe I'm wrong I could be wrong but if we're looking at the data showing us that what you're doing here is just taking what's real and then just tweaking it so that way your eye actually pops on screen adding some contrast cleaning up your background a little bit totally fine but um I think those are just ways to just leverage that authenticity definitely wear the same clothes in your video I think that's going to help um drive that authenticity when people watch your video Dave altiser was talking about he did a video where he was um showing off like an iPhone tutorial and the first image the thumbnail was the first image of the video so when you clicked on the thumbnail boom ready you're confirmed that you're watching the video you set out to see versus cutting away to a talking head that maybe is not that immediate payoff so those are little tweaks you can make um and I like what you're doing here just kind of taking it as if you were in a studio cleaning up a little bit um it just feels a little bit more I guess authentic is what we're seeing here yeah and right now if you're curious as we land the plane um using Dolly and just kind of like throwing in some AI images maybe getting the actual dimensions right and all those kinds of things could be of course important uh but uh so that because even the perspective and like what exactly is happening here but we're living in an interesting era and I guess even yeah the light's kind of in a weird spot but like you know sort of actually I guess probably you might have like field of view and once you get it underneath yeah I I compared to just design and I I I loved your point because we were doing our YouTube challenge and I was making a thumbnail in like under two minutes or under three minutes and I think the the modern point was that was just to get people started but what people are so used to seeing now is like everyone's seeing the same canva template so it's and and on this like designed background with the same red with the you know little whatever like we see some of the things so it's how could we be different and if possible if you could take photos in your own environment or um different things and still I do think the tweaks to it whether dimming the background you know I put a drop shadow on myself here some colors some different things you can certainly still do some things to make the pop but yet you're still in that authentic environment we're tapping into that authenticity uh Revolution hey was that uh helpful little tutorial Nate good way to land the plane did made the plane take off again it was like I was like well let's open up canva and Ai and just dive into some stuff but I appreciate you thanks for um adding so much value today and if you got value from Nate's tips smash the like button um also today's stream was brought to you by vid iq.com think if you want to grab a $1 trial of the 30-day version of um 30 days of IQ boost uh I am curious what kind of niches are you in here and do you have any questions as we land the plane today but like what's your YouTube channel Niche um why I'm asking you that as well I would love to get as many questions as we can but we do have to land the plane pretty soon and so I did a new Post in the community tab it looks like this um and on this post it's a carousel I just ask for your questions and I'm also asking you to upvote questions so if you head over to that post on the think media Community Tab and post your question upvote any of the questions you like I'm going to do a new batch of the whatever we're calling this repeatable long form Series where I kind of take one question and then do a deep dive on it so that's another place you could post that but uh let's see um my Niche is a bit of travel and lifestyle in Ecuador is GM a here so one of the Cool Tools on vid IQ is called the generate tool and if you were to say eador um day in the life if you have a general idea and you use the generate tool of vid IQ let's check out the tips here and this is using vid IQ so first thing as I just typed in a general idea it's actually going to give us a couple of the top related keywords now some people would say this doesn't matter and they're wrong it's not that it matters because those tags are going to help you it matters in helping you position your video to know what kind of Search terms or language or words so you really dial in your video idea properly okay so ultimately then it comes up with a title Ecuador in 24 hours a day in the life of an Ecuadorian which is amazing because now you know okay cool what could I get accomplished in 24 hours you reverse engineer the video if you click over here you could make it longer shorter add excitement change the tone maybe make it a little more witty and you could spin the title until you get it correct now this is one of the biggest principles we always talk about too we research before we press record we um we want to know our title even before we film the video if possible so 24 hours in Ecuador a day in the life living like an Ecuadorian for 24 hours Okay cool so you figure out your idea and then you also see some different tags which by the way even if they don't matter that much because again the tags themselves aren't going to move the needle you could just copy paste these tags and move them over to your video to reinforce the uh YouTube Understanding what your video is about and then it's giving us some thumbnail inspiration now it's not that you're going to use these thumbnails but it's G giving you the inspiration for the shot composition of what your thumbnail could be these are all great they're vibrant shot composition okay let me let me shoot a couple maybe and let me pre-plan my thumbnails so they pop in most cases no text in this case only 24 hours you could choose a different font uh maybe get rid of the only to say 24 hours and then it tees you up with a hook and even an outline with the hook introduction presentation of problem and challenge then the storytelling stuff that Nate was talking about earlier vid IQ will do that heavy lifting for you it'll walk you through be thinking about introducing a problem and Challenge and then be thinking about the exploration and development of that and then be thinking about the climax and the key moment and what's the conclusion in the summary and you could generate even a greater skip if script if you want this is just one Tool It's called The generate tool and um it's part of a suite of tools that vid IQ has that you can check out if you want so anyways shout out to vid IQ for uh being one of our partners at think media vid iq.com think if you want to try out a 30-day trial of vid iq's boost plan and try the generate tool try the outliers tool we talked about earlier Link in the description um and it's just $1 if you want to cancel before the deadline then um I don't know where else you're going to spend a dollar but that's probably the best use I mean of all things you could spend a dollar on this month you know pitch me in the comments if you think there's another way there's not a lot of ways you could spend a dollar these days so it's pretty cool um all right if you have any questions uh let's see Kelly says vid IQ is worth it it grades your titles and thumbnails which is very helpful I agree uh let's see made by uh pan said uh vid IQ is really useful I agree appreciate it and um yeah crazy value for a dollar good call it's not a lot of things you could get for a dollar there is one of my favorite instagrammers right now though his name's Damon darling and he and he and he talks about you got a dollar and then they say no and he goes oh here you go everyone in America should have a darn dollar look him up man that's that's going to be an Instagram Rabbit Hole to travel down for a while um and with that uh I think that uh it was a pretty good stream we're an hour and 33 minutes in check the replay out because we covered a lot of stuff we T covered at least 10 Trends probably really more than that and if you're just joining um the time codes and chapters

no one's going to click on our video if you don't write a good title what if the only reason that people weren't watching your videos was that you were choosing bad titles the best titles create an emotional response that cause you to click the three I'm calling them click-worthy emotions are curiosity fear and desire and it's usually curiosity plus fear or curiosity plus desire that's Jake Thomas he's the writer of a popular newsletter called Creator hooks which is dedicated to helping you write better YouTube titles based in human psychology what I love about Jake's approach is that he's very data driven I've got a database of 408 titles right now 61 of them have curiosity 46 have desired 40 have fear or negativity so in this episode you'll learn how to research your own titles how to leverage human psychology to get more views some of the most successful Frameworks Jake has found and why curiosity is the most impactful emotion that you can tap into but now let's talk with Jake [Music] [Music] a lot of people when they're you know just starting their trying to do some research look at other channels that are kind of like them but I feel like a lot of people are also sucked into the Trap of saying I'm just gonna model off of the biggest names in the business I'm gonna go and see what Mr Beast is doing I'm gonna go see what Emma Chamberlain is doing I'm gonna go just like see what these people are doing really well and model after that because if it's working for them it seems like it should work for me is that the right way to think about it and if not how should I be doing research across different channels for my titles I don't think it's the the right way to do it so if I got Emma Chamberlain's titles up right now cooking Ugg season my childhood bedroom it will be okay so like she has a title that's literally just cooking and that's all it is and unless you're Emma Chamberlain that is not going to work for you unless you have let's see 11.8 million subscribers it will not work because it's just just like a plain statement there's no emotion there so no I think that you should uh model people a couple steps ahead of you you know like if you're just getting started maybe you want to model people in the you know 50 000 or you know five thousand fifty thousand five hundred thousand someone who's not like a just total celebrity and just has like you know so much influence outside of YouTube that no matter what like they're going to be successful so definitely don't look at the people way high up try to find people a couple steps ahead of you see what they're doing and I think that's like just definitely the best thing that you can do especially getting started if you don't know anything like even like you know how do I write my intros how do I do my lighting how long should my video be when you're getting started all the answers are there but just looking at what is working for your competitors and then you know as you kind of do that you'll slowly get like kind of your own feel and your own Vibe but definitely the best way to do it is to kind of copy first like people do like copy work like you know you hand write old sales letters to learn how to become a good copywriter people have been recommending that for like I don't know 70 years or something like that and it's been working for them don't try to be like super original don't try to model an mha Berlin no offense in her but it's probably not going to work for you try to find people a couple steps ahead of you and do what they're doing I think that's good advice for creators of any kind actually because it's it's really easy to go and and look after these bigger channels or creators or Platforms in general and think well if they're doing it it must work but there have been some times in my life where I've looked at uh landing pages home pages sales pages of big websites and said oh this must be what works and then copied that and then within like days or weeks they change it because it probably wasn't performing so like not only should you look at people who are closer to you but maybe you should even reach out to people and ask if there's not like clear public data you should reach out and say hey I'm just curious how this is going for you maybe not the first question in their Twitter DMS but you know get get to it because I think that's a really smart advice sometimes people are succeeding in spite of not doing things in the most effective way yeah definitely but also like if you're just getting started like just just do it like don't let analysis paralysis you know kind of stop you from taking action like all right cool like when I first launched my um my newsletter I had like a really really ugly newsletter title or sorry newsletter um like landing page it was terrible like my conversion rate was bad when I got started and then I kind of asked around and I started looking at others and I eventually figured it out but uh just like copying like the first landing page that I saw like worked for me to get up and just get moving and another thing that someone told me this a couple of weeks ago and it was you can't sit your parked car and I was like oh this is great like um yeah when you're when you're just getting started like just move yes and then figure it out yes how did you get to YouTube titles of all things I've been in like Marketing in general for like 10 years or so I was uh I worked at a Facebook Ad Agency and it was it was terrible and our my favorite client they were like Hey we're hiring a writer so I was able to like jump on board with them and I hadn't had I didn't have any YouTube experience but he's like hey you're going to be our editor-in-chief our media buyer and our YouTube channel manager and I was like oh this is great like no no YouTube experience and my boss was like a really really good copywriter and he beat into my head the importance of writing titles he's like because we were a fishing channel and we had like spent a lot of money to send our fishing coaches out uh you know like kayaking or out on the boat spending all day like making content so we would we spent a lot of money on our content and he's like if you don't write a good title then we wasted all of this money you know filming creating uh you know fishing catching all these fish and also uh if you don't write a good title then we're not going to get any of the benefits like no one's going to click on our video if you don't write a good title so like the pressure was on that sounds like a lot of pressure yeah it was and the only problem was he was great and like my favorite Boss by far but he wasn't like a he didn't know how to teach me how to write good YouTube titles so it's kind of on my own uh I almost got fired because I was so bad at first oh no and like I actually talked to him about it like a couple years after and I was like yeah like when I got started it wasn't the best he's like yeah it wasn't it wasn't the best we weren't sure if we were gonna keep you you're telling me it wasn't the best but but somehow I kind of figured it out and the thing that like the thing that made it click for me was we were a fishing channel and my boss went on a podcast of a hunting channel and they did a podcast that was uh newbie hunting gear and the guy said like that newbie hunting gear podcast crushed it for them so my boss came back he's like hey we're gonna do a podcast about newbie fishing gear so I was like all right cool like let's do it turns out that was our best podcast like for the month like for the past few months that's when it kind of clicked it was like okay I don't need to be original I need to just like find something that works and then model that and it's not like copying right like you know there was newbie hunting gear where newbie fishing gear like we're just following that same model and then once I realized that I got on a roll and like I finally understood like okay like it's not all up to me to be like totally original and write these great titles and then we find it like turn it around I didn't get fired our Channel like 3x our Revenue Forex so everything was everything was good after that and then once like kind of I figured out all right cool like this is how you write a good YouTube title like from a beginner then I slowly figured it out and I was like oh cool like here are the patterns that all of these successful YouTube titles have now we can kind of get out of that box of like just modeling to like actually coming up with original content how did you go about finding these templates of breakout sort of successes because it seems like YouTube has just an endless amount of content so how did you boil that ocean start to way fine to specific title structures that worked for you just spending a lot of time studying YouTube titles you know going to a bunch of different channels and YouTube makes it super easy because you can see the publish date you can see how many views they have and just like just spending hours every single week for over a year or you know almost two years now just like scanning like okay like you know this video is published uh you know a couple weeks ago but it has like a hundred thousand views all of the other videos published around it have like ten thousand okay there's something here and then you take note of that and you do that you know a thousand times a couple hundred times then boom you start to see you start to see pattern so it's really just putting in time and studying and taking really deliberate notes how much were you looking at the same industry and channels in that same industry versus something that might be like a little bit orthogonal to it like it's kind of touching that industry versus something that's completely out of that industry but doing well really just like trying to get a a broad spectrum of Industries like the craziest thing is when I see today I was looking at it was like a like a hair Channel and one of their best videos like I was like oh I've seen like this exact model work on like all sorts of other different channels yeah so just really just trying to get a really broad spectrum of titles and then you know putting all those notes together and like seeing the patterns and it's like oh it really doesn't matter like what industry this is in like you know regrets always work well or something like that when you're doing this are you putting this into a spreadsheet is it structured is it just gut feel and if it is structured how does that look it is a little structured that's just in Google Sheets so I've just got like the title The publish date and like the the URL and it just started as that and then as I started to recognize patterns it's like okay like let me know this one had fear Okay and like then I would go through all the other you know 100 titles that I had before all right this one had fear this one had fear this one had fear cool okay like you know 30 of these titles have fear and then I would start to notice like new patterns so it was just it was real it's really simple just in Google Sheets and there's it's nothing fancy just as I you know as I kept learning new things like all right let me jot it down let me see if I can organize this a little better and just so people are on the same page you're not talking about the literal word fear you're talking about the emotional pull of fear correct yes correct okay talk more about that because I I've heard you talk about some of these emotions that you think underlie a good title is it fair to say that emotions are what make a good title yeah so a couple a couple weeks ago I was looking at this guy's Channel and he was struggling with his YouTube channel and he's like hey man like I'm putting in all the work I'm like you know my uh my thumbnails are getting better my storytelling my editing is getting better like what why am I not growing and I looked at his titles and they were all bland statements like there was no emotion and the three I'm calling them click-worthy emotions are curiosity fear and desire and it's usually curiosity plus fear or curiosity plus desire and that's like the simplest way to explain what makes a good title is just curiosity for your desire you know and there's a bunch of different nuances you know below that but that's like the just the high level version of what makes a good title I like that you're focusing on kind of emotional terms and ideas as opposed to strictly like templated language because I'm sure there are Trends within language that work pretty well but I would imagine they they probably get stale also so when you're looking at curiosity fear and desire and saying I want to tie capacity to fear or curiosity to desire how often are you seeing trends like go in and out so far I haven't and it's been a couple years so I haven't seen any like big trends go in and out yet like the main Trend that I that comes to mind is like a like a 20 like 14 BuzzFeed article like 36 new podcast mics you'll never guess number 17 or something like that doctors hate this guy yeah yeah and like but it's still using like there's curiosity there's like a little bit of fear there you know it's a list and that those things still work well it's just like how you apply them people kind of cut on and now it's like all right that's too clickbaity for me but I mean it's the still the same principles were working back then and they're still working now and I've read a lot of like you know copywriting books from like the 30s 1930s 1950s 60s and they're all just saying the same thing like it's it's all psychology that gets people's attention and gets people to click do you have any examples of titles that are pulling on curiosity and fear or curiosity and desire that people can kind of start to map this in their mind to what this looks like just kind of to get like super nerdy here I've got a database of 408 titles right now and 61 of them have curiosity 46 have desire and 40 percent have fear or negativity so wow a couple of examples here seven things plant experts do that you probably don't that kind of opens up a loop there it's like oh like in that opening a loop is a great way to build curiosity you're starting a story but not finishing it when you read that title like oh what are these plant experts doing that I'm not so there's a lot of curiosity yes yes it's there's fomo there you know which is like you know fear of missing out so there's fear there's also curiosity like what are these things that these plant experts are doing what about desire give me a desire example how a pro YouTuber actually makes thumbnails like just the word actually is like really simple you kind of feel like you're getting in on a secret there like how they actually do that it's like okay like I thought that I knew how they make titles or how they make thumbnails but like here's how they really do it here's how they actually do it kind of feels like they're you know like kind of giving you Insider information or you know you know pulling back the curtain there so you feel like you're getting in on a secret so that's one way to build curiosity but you're also speaking to a desire so you know if you want to make better thumbnails it's like oh here's how the pros do it so there's Authority there as well so you have desire you have curiosity by revealing a secret and then you also are you're talking about Authority so like that has like some instant trust and credibility credibility there because this is how the pros do it when you are writing titles for yourself or for other people knowing what you know what is your starting point for making a title it starts with the idea it's like putting lipstick on a pig like if you have a bad idea it doesn't matter how clever you are at like word smithing good titles or or how you know good of a graphic designer or good of a thumbnail maker are if you have a bad idea then you're just wasting your time so it always starts with the idea and that's that's the most important thing and then just coming from there it's like you know what angle do we want to kind of attack this topic and that kind of depends on what have we done before and like a lot of people say the secret to like creating content is just saying the same thing 100 different ways because there are like there are some ideas or some topics that just work well no matter what so you just got to kind of you know ride that wave while you can but the secret is like just saying that a bunch of different ways so for an example like let's say we're a finance Channel talking about like picking stocks so you could say like how to pick stocks as a beginner right so you know talk to beginners and like be calling out beginners is a great way to get people to click because you're calling out a specific audience not only is that audience like like very specific like if you're a beginner like if you see like kind of your name right there in the title it's like oh shoot this this video is for me but also they're like the hungriest right you know because they're beginners they want to learn and they're the most insecure so uh right now I'm learning how to play the piano I'm learning on YouTube and I went through a through a YouTube um Channel teaching piano and I was watching like all their videos on how to play the piano after like two hours I'm laying in bed and I'm like wait what did I just do and I watched all of the videos that had the word beginner in them and that was because I was like insecure about my piano playing skills like rightfully so because I was a beginner and I felt that all the other videos were they were too advanced for me like oh you know this song or this exercise is too advanced like give me something for me give me something specific for beginners so I was insecure like I felt that like like this video was just for me so that that's a you know one great uh way to get people to click is to just call out beginners right there in your title so if you're you know making your stocks video how to pick stocks for beginners you could talk about like you know the best uh the best stocks in uh you know November 2022 timeliness is another good one um you could talk about like regrets like I regret picking these stocks last year people love regrets ah those are just like a couple different ways of saying the same thing over and over again and I'm calling them click triggers there's like 31 and we've already talked about a lot of them like you know revealing a secret opening a loop regrets um it's just like fear desire all that stuff and those are just like kind of moves that like moves that you can make or like pitches that you have like in Your Arsenal like you know how am I gonna if you're a pitcher you're looking at Aaron judge and like how am I going to get him out first off there and judge it's not gonna happen but uh but you're like all right you know what am I gonna throw him like you know the sink or the slider the fastball change up you know and that's how I kind of look at these click triggers it's like all right what's the best way uh to get people to click and get people excited about this topic the we had to use visual b-roll there so that people watching this you know like sports Aaron judge pitcher what what does mean uh I'm also like thinking to myself we've got to find some way to get video of Jake playing piano now I love it after a quick break Jake and I get even more in the weeds of how he researches and chooses titles and later we dive into some of the theories that Jake has that he's still collecting data about so stick around we'll be right back if you like creative elements you would love my Weekly Newsletter Creator science I send it every Sunday and it breaks down everything I'm learning about how to be a professional Creator it expands on the things we talk about here on this show and it even goes behind the scenes of my own business and shows you what I'm doing what I'm experimenting with in my own Journey if you're serious about this I think it is a must read more than 14 000 creators already subscribe so if you are not already subscribed go to creatorscience.com And subscribe for free and I'll talk to you on Sunday welcome back to my conversation with Jake Thomas before the break Jake and I were talking about his research process and something I shared with Jake is that one of my favorite ways to do my own research is to pay close attention to the things that drive me to take action if I click something why did I click that if I buy something why did I buy that I have a I actually have like an Evernote document from like 20 like 16 or 2015 or something and that was like my first like uh obsession with titles and like what gets people to click because I was that was like when I was really like learning everything I didn't know anything I was just kind of starting to try to make it online then I was like oh wow like I'm you know um this this article really caught my eye so I would put in the document and I was like oh this one caught my eye too I put in the document and I noticed after like the first five they were all fear-based I was like all right is this just is this just me like what what is going on here fear is working very well on me I hate that about our psychology it's such a bummer but it's true but like the idea of titling all of my videos to like prey on people's fears and insecurities it's just like so antithetical to what I want to do but like I get it I get that it works we have this little bit of tension with with our Channel where we know like hey you know what YouTube audiences they love to talk about money they love to hear about money they love to look at money that historically has never been what the show is about but like I get it so we play the game a little bit but I'm I'm constantly fighting against like what how much am I youtubing this show and going too far yeah are you like are you just gonna try to find a balance there are you gonna like stick to your guns and like just know that it's a it's a really good question because I and I'd love to hear your take on this I feel like we're already playing the game on hard mode a little bit because long form interviews not the typical content that does well on YouTube now it seems like there might be some Tailwinds there where YouTube is saying like we actually want to encourage this type of content and behavior I feel like we're entering an already hard game and playing it from like the hardest perspective and titling comes up sometimes because it feels like we should lean into the name recognition of the guest in the title because that's probably our best angle and then Conor does a really good job of finding some of these these uh trends that you've talked about like we've used the secret a couple of times in the title but it's hard because that video the payoff to that video is one part of the interview and there's all kinds of stuff that goes into the interview so if it was just me and I wasn't trying to play any type of game it would just be like episode whatever Jake Thomas and that would be it but I don't think that would work so well what do you think I agree I mean there's that that balance and like I'm doing it a lot so I have a dog YouTube channel I got a dog email list and a dog blog and then also I'm on Twitter and then I do some other stuff for clients and but on Twitter like one of my best uh threads or like 99 of people suck at writing YouTube titles and it's just like just totally bashing fear like all negativity there it's like every time I do that like those types of titles just work well and I don't know I go I go back and forth one way to I'm just going to kind of deflect this question that is not what you do one one way to uh to like make like turn that uh ickiness dial down is to say like you will regret uh you know not titling your YouTube your YouTube videos like this right that's like you're turning that way up like that just feels icky like you will regret it doesn't feel good but if you say I regret titling my YouTube video like this oh it's an experience thing it's not like an attack it's like yeah this is my experience yes yes sharing your story you know my biggest mistake I regret so like if you want to use like the the like the really effective emotion of fear but you want to turn the ickiness dial down share your own story or like he did this not like just taking out the word you you know that's the probably the best way to do it but for me it kind of depends on like how is my business going like if I'm growing it's like all right cool yeah I'm gonna be a little bit less aggressive right now like I don't really I don't need this thread to do super well like I just want to kind of serve my audience if I'm like dang the newsletter is not really growing right now I really need to step up growth then I'll be like okay let me let me play this game not on hard mode let me let me do what I know works even though I may feel not the best about it but still you know still not like being like totally fear-mongery and clickbaity I mean I don't know if that's a good answer but that's how I think about it a little bit when you have like competing ideas for a title let's say that the idea itself is good you feel good about it and you're looking at different types of titles that all are playing on curiosity and fear or curiosity and desire how do you end up making a decision which one to go with one thing that I'll do is I will like just search my title and try to see has this uh has this done well in the past so like we let's say that you're in kind of an obscure Niche like let's say you were doing you know like steam mops uh I don't know if steam mops are popular maybe they are so if you were like uh you know my biggest regret uh you know buying my first steam mop or if you wanted to say like I'm like all right cool I could do that or I could say like you know five mistakes to buying your Steam Mop you could write that same title but like with vacuums or something like a little bit broader and you because I'm just looking for that Trend like has this has this trend for something similar in this you know similar to this has it worked before like YouTube will tell you YouTube is great like like I said they have the view date and the or the published date and the view counts so they'll let you know yes this has worked or no this has not worked let's say that I wanted to lean into this strategy and as an interviewer who's already pegged the guest name is important for the title which would you agree should I be using that as one of the most important parts of the title it depends for me uh no like I'm I don't think my name I don't I'm not like a heavy hitter but if you're interviewing garyvee absolutely you know if you were titling this interview you might do something like you know the best way to write YouTube titles or five YouTube title mistakes everybody you're probably making or something like that something a little bit spicier than that my name isn't care doesn't carry a ton of weight so I would either give my I'd either like skip it or you could say like you know uh the biggest YouTube title nerd or something give me a label I don't think it would be like the best thing to do yes you could and uh one one of these days maybe my name will carry weight but um but I would give myself a label or uh you know just you know talk about a benefit or something or a mistake or fear or something like that if I were to lean into Justin Welsh let's say he has a growing profile more people are searching for his name if before we release our episode we search Justin Welsh and we look at the first five videos that are listed there how closely should we model the actual titles of videos that are doing well versus use that to say let's do something completely different it depends so probably like with with Justin like he's blowing up but also he's like not that big like you know this isn't like a this isn't a super big space right so if you model it really closely that's kind of that's teetering on the the um the okay this is like kind of sort of copying uh but not really so you know in the case of like because like this is a small smaller industry I don't know you you might want to figure out what are the elements like that are making people click like the creative elements oh what is yes what are these creative title elements that are making people click like do do all of them have like you know two million dollars in them or do all of them have you know solopreneur in them or you know other things that you might include and it's like okay I definitely need to include the number like you know how the solopreneur made what you know however many millions of dollars like that's it like that's a great hook and I'm gonna do it but if they're all different then it's like okay cool like this is this is kind of a free-for-all uh there's no real themes here I'm just just gonna you know pick you know the most interesting thing about the video or the most interesting thing about Justin and go for it how do you think about brevity because as you're listing off some of these they they seem pretty concise and I could easily reason my way into saying let me just add like three tags because we talk about three different categories in this podcast so what if I just say here are the five mistakes people make here are the 10 best YouTube titles and also here is why you need to be thinking about curiosity desire and fear and put that all into a title yeah I think there's a I'm gonna spit like some cliche things at you like if you confuse you loose if there's like so many different uh like it's kind of like keyword stuffing almost but like not really keyword stuffing just a bunch of different things if you confuse you lose so if your keyword is like really long then you know it's just not easy to instantly understand also uh no Focus no audience so you know the more commas and the more ands you put in your title like the longer it is it's just not going to have a focus it's not gonna have like as much power to like it's not really gonna pack a punch and people like oh I really I really want to watch this I'm doing a bunch of a b tests on whether or not the word and or like having multiple subjects affects a uh affects a title so I will have some more data for you there but I'm I'm just I'm trying not to use the word and I'm trying to be brief I'm trying to focus on just one thing just like the single most powerful thing you know this is YouTube and people are scrolling and you know you want someone to like instantly latch on to that one thing if there are three different subjects there then it's going to take people a long time to read it a lot a lot longer of a time to read it than if it was just one subject it's going to take people longer to understand it and like that's too much work for their brain if they're just scrolling so the likelihood is greater that they're just going to um that they're just going to just kind of scroll on by here's some data for you so my email subject lines so I run the Creator hooks newsletter and it used to be Creator Hooks and then I would list out three things like you know biggest YouTube fears YouTube mistakes and hitting a million subscribers so it was always that Creator hooks colon three things and then I switched to only having like only kind of modeling one of the titles from Creator hooks it was a little shorter it was more concise it was one idea and my email opened rate open rate went from about 35 to about 50 percent oh wow so it was like 35 to 40 and now it's like 45 to 55. so having you know just one thing has helped I love this data this is so good one thing that you haven't mentioned is thumbnails or description so I guess that's two things and I think we both agree that having a good con good idea with good content is prerequisite let's say that that like that's what you should focus on is having a good idea have good content because none of this probably matters if not how do you weigh titles versus thumbnails do descriptions matter at all we are are getting a little bit out of my expertise I'm mostly just nerding out on titles as far as descriptions go I don't think they matter that much I mean YouTube is smart and they have a lot of things that they're looking at you know tags and descriptions I think are less important than YouTube like actually seeing what is in the video because they do that and like all right this is what the video is about like it doesn't maybe it doesn't matter as much as like this the description so they know what your video is about thumbnails this is my personal opinion but I think that thumbnails are more important in entertainment and titles are more important in education um I I think because you can show a story much better in entertainment so yeah you need to have a killer thumbnail in education it's not as it's not as important I think it's still obviously very important but I think that you need to have a great idea and convey that idea mostly in the title I think the the title is kind of the best way to plainly convey that idea spicy takes I like this I like the spicy takes when you are playing around titles and I know you test titles you do a b testing on these things how frequently do you do that like when is too early to say and this isn't performing the way I thought time for me to go back to the drawing board and try another title so I usually wait I wait it out because I am fairly confident in my titles for the most part also I've seen like some of my videos have blown up like after like a day and a half like just kind of randomly like you know here's my graph and all of a sudden I'm like oh I didn't do anything and then all of a sudden it like kind of usually drops off too but I didn't I didn't make any changes to make it blow up I didn't make any changes to make it slow down but what I always do with my a b testing is I wait five days days because if you test too early YouTube is you know showing your video to your subscribers so people are way more likely to click on the first day and then it kind of goes down and with a B testing I use tubebuddy or thumbnailtest.com those are two different tools I think the only way to a B test right now is switching the title or or the or the thumbnail every 24 hours knowing that it switches every 24 hours if you launch your test on the first day your first day is almost always going to be the highest CTR because the YouTube is going to show it to like your most loyal followers and people who are clicking on the first day are usually your most loyal followers so just kind of by default you're way more likely to have a higher CTA on day one than day two so that's just kind of gonna give you bad data right there so I wait at least five days for things to kind of like settle down and it's like all right cool now I'm going to test this and I know that this is going to give me the most accurate data because that kind of wild crazy almost like inflated data in the first couple days is gone so I wait a couple days I test it out I know a lot of people test it out like within an hour or two hours and yeah yeah and I don't know how I feel about that I usually don't do that I mean if it's if your video is like really flopping like yeah maybe maybe go with your plan B I just like to get real data I love studying the A B test data and it's not perfect but if you use it as like a compass say okay these Trends work for me these Trends don't work for me like not that okay this was 10.2 percent higher like you know this is this is the one it's more like okay cool like in 10 different tests like this theme is working way more than this theme like I'm gonna use this theme more going forward so yeah so just wait it out um or sorry that's what I do I wait it out I know a lot of people don't do that and then I try to get real data and I try to just kind of learn from that I haven't used tubebuddy or any of these tools paint me a visual picture of what that looks like to use a tool like that to test these things with uh tubebuddy um you can upload you know one alternate you know so you're a b testing you can't a b c d test so then you'll upload you know a thumbnail or a title you can do both I would definitely recommend only doing one at a time unless you were testing like a whole new idea then you might want to have a new set of title and thumbnail it's like super simple we just upload it uh you know click like run test and then you'll set like how many days you want to test I usually test for seven days per title so on tubebuddy if you're only testing you know another alternate then it'll be 14 days come back 14 days later and then you can see the results like it'll show you the click-through rate I'm going to show you the Impressions you know clicks for impression also show you the watch time it'll help you know like you know sometimes you might have a much higher click-through rate but maybe your average view duration went down and it's like okay maybe this video is clickbait or this title was like two clickbaity like people just clicked it and went away right away what I've often seen and maybe like this is just me like reading bad data and making like making assumptions there I've often seen a higher click-through rate correlate with um a higher watch time I think that's because people are just if you write a more interesting title people are more excited to uh watch it so like yeah more people are clicking on it because they're more excited to watch it so they're gonna give it a longer shot than like maybe people like people were kind of doubting it like ah I'll click it and like you know they're just going into it like I probably don't want to watch this video and you're just gonna confirm their beliefs right away when you don't have like some crazy insane intro so when you're making an A B test in tubebuddy they aren't able to do that in real time across titles are they can they serve like different audiences different titles and give you a real-time tests across okay so it's like a global change for a period of time yes yes I uh I don't love that they they change it every 24 hours and then they look at the data for that time period and they kind of aggregate that data so yeah I don't love it it's not perfect and that's why I say use it as a compass to say okay like this is a trend not like all right this is like this is the law when we come back Jake and I talk about chapter titles in YouTube and some of the theories that he's still testing so stick with me we'll be right back hey thanks for watching creative elements this is a brand new channel here on YouTube so liking the videos leaving comments subscribing the channel sharing the show all that support goes a long long way right now it is all seen it is all appreciated and even though this is a brand new channel here on YouTube I've actually been conducting interviews with creators just like this for more than two years there are more than 100 interviews that you can go back and listen to with creators like Seth Godin James Clear Cody Sanchez Tori Dunlap even YouTubers like Ali abdall Matt diovella Roberto Blake and Marie Poulin I've actually created some playlists for you to help get you started to dive into some of the best episodes that we've done to date just go to creative elements.fm playlists the link is also Down Below in the description but you can filter episodes there by platform or medium if you want to just look at episodes with YouTubers or just episodes with instagramers you can do that with those starter playlists at creative elements.fm playlist and again link is down below in the description hey welcome back you may have noticed that in our videos we have chapter markers all throughout the video and the reason we do that is I've seen those chapter markers get pulled into Google search results so I asked Jake how he thinks about chapter markers and if he makes good use of them I don't use them for my uh for My Dog Channel and maybe this is me like like trying to be like old school maybe too direct marketer but like I want people to watch the whole video I don't want them to like skip like right to all right let me just skip to this like single chapter only watch like what I want like I kind of want to suck them in and maybe this is like a maybe this is a bad we'll watch this whole video yes that that is what I'm thinking and uh maybe that's like not the best like user experience maybe that's just me the ingredient I don't know but uh that is how I'm going about it right now if someone has like some good data to change why uh to change my attitude on that I will happily uh listen but as of now I am not doing chat and and I've seen mixed review I've seen people who are much smarter than me let's tell you what I just told you I've also seen people who are much smarter than me actually use them on their channel so I don't think that anybody has like a a good solid answer for that how do you curate an uh an issue of Creator hooks how do you decide what goes in at that week what you talk about I imagine you are probably looking at far more videos than make it end in a typical week everything is based on a hook score and what that is is how how many views a video got above their average for the channel kind of like recent average so I'll look at you know if a video got a million views I'll look at the 10 videos like or the five videos before and after so kind of 10 videos and we'll calculate that average and I'll be like okay cool like this you know Channel averages about a hundred thousand views of video but boom this one had a million views so there's something about this video that people can learn from so the problem uh with that approach is that some channels just put out Banger after Banger and like there's like there's no deviation from the average so that is that is one problem with that so that can like take me a while where I'll just go through 10 channels and every video is a banger and it's like oh well I can't use any of these in the newsletter because like you know there's nothing telling me that this did better than the other so I have a list of like 300 channels that I I'll scroll through those 300 channels and I've had a lot of people in travel recently sign up for my newsletter so I'm trying to just find like uh outliers outlier videos in the travel industry I will go and I'll poke around I'll find like one channel that like does travel videos like I'll watch one of their videos and I'll see what's recommended and like you know are there any other channels or other kind of outliers that were recommended I'll do that process for like I don't know 20 or 30 minutes and then I'll go to my home page and it's all outlier videos of travel videos so just kind of doing that process and just playing around trying to find like just one video that blew out up and outperform the other videos on that channel so yeah so the list and just just playing around on YouTube for hours and like two three four hours on a Thursday or Friday afternoon and try to get YouTube to suggest outlier videos to me and then eventually I'll get five and I'll put those in the in the newsletter how often do you use the Curiosity plus desire or fear framework for the subject lines of your emails the whole like kind of idea behind Creator hooks is that you can use like kind of the same hooks no matter like kind of what industry you're in I just model one of the videos that were in the newsletter so last week's this new approach to YouTube will change your channel forever that was based on this video of this new approach to photography will change your channel forever you know for my email subject line I modeled a photography YouTube video title so in a sense it is a little bit you know clickbaity because it's not I'm not delivering on the title but I'm more of like kind of being an example of saying hey here is how I would use this hook and I'm going to use it in an email subject line and it's still going to get people to click and be happy they clicked I've had like three people say oh like you didn't deliver on you didn't say what you said in the in the email subject line and I've explained it to them and everyone has kind of kind of understood but yeah I'm just I'm just modeling YouTube video titles from a variety of Industries for my YouTube email newsletter and that has worked well for like 52 open rate I might try this model more closely aligned with what I am writing in the newsletter but like the Curiosity desire curiosity fear model for subject lines the problem is I try to stay within like six to eight words in a subject line so it doesn't get truncated on a mobile phone and I feel like it would be hard to do that with this model like you'd have to be real concise because you're gonna have to start with some sort of emotional language like how to or something where you aren't even talking about what's in the newsletter yet yeah that is one of the most frustrating things is like especially on YouTube just making sure uh you're kind of within those character limits a couple like reasons why that's important is like one like if it's too long you know if people are skimming they're not going to see it and two it also might get truncated you know it's the same thing with email subject lines like it depends where people are opening your email it depends where people are watching your YouTube videos if you write a really long title it's going to get truncated so that's that's definitely like one of the hardest things about writing titles is how can you pack as much like emotion and information while being like clear uh in you know less than 55 characters or whatever what we haven't talked about at all is SEO search engine optimization YouTube as a search engine how much do you think about that when it relates as it relates to titles because it seems like an opportunity that I've heard some people speak to but it doesn't sound from what we've shared so far like that's a big strategy on on your list real quick can I tell you a story going back to email subject lines I love story time all right so I have a Blog it's about Golden Retrievers and when I started to start a Creator hooks I was in the middle of a series on my blog and it was like eight month old Golden Retrievers chewing biting you know potty training then I did three month old Golden Retrievers four month old gold retrievers five-month-old golden retrievers and three and four month old Golden Retrievers the email like the click-through rate my click-through rate is like I don't know eight percent or so between like six and ten percent when I was doing kind of the boring subject lines I was just like three month old Golden Retrievers you know it's keyword stuffing my click-through rate was like four percent on those and I was like dang this stinks like what if I did the creator hooks approach to this so for five month old Golden Retrievers which is like not as like sexy as like two month old golden retrievers like because it's super new like if you have a five month old Golden Retriever now you're kind of settled in so I did why teenage golden retrievers were the worst and that doubled my click-through rate it went for like four percent to like like 8.5 or like nine percent and that was that was using negativity there it was like you know using fear like and it was also using a label like we talked about labels earlier instead of five month old Golden Retrievers it was Teenage golden retrievers so it was a little bit broader but also like still very descriptive and then I used negativity just talking about why they're the worst Ted is 10 months old right now and he is definitely the worst right now [Laughter] so you're saying right for the human don't write for the robot um I like that advice although it does seem like man there's got to be some marriage of the two because I feel like I mean the magic that I see on this channel is when YouTube is like hey we should put this on the home feed we put this in the browse features but it seems like a lot of the back catalog success right now like Justin Welsh that's succeeding on the strength of his name being searched and so I feel like there's some marriage here that I'm trying to find and it also depends on kind of where we're trying to like where we're trying to get our content shown so in the email subject line it's all like attention like kind of interruption marketing right so in that case why teenage gold retrievers are the worst like worked a lot better than kind of a another you know kind of like a boring one but when I published the blog post my subject line was five month old Golden Retrievers keyword stuffing right so it does depend on you know where you're trying to get people like if you're trying to rank in search it might be a little bit different than if you're trying to get views from like browse or like the home page or like recommended and stuff so like going back to SEO one of the things that you could do is have like kind of the main subject up front and then have like one of the click triggers like something that's going to get people a click at the end you might if we're talking about uh Justin Welsh you know how Justin Welsh so you have his name the keyword right in front you know made 10 uh you know made a million dollars in 2022 as a solopreneur or something towards the end like you have timeliness so like in 2022 you have like you know made a million dollars like a huge desire so just following up things uh following up your main subject at the end is one of a one of the better ways that I've seen people rank on search so you can use like a big desire so like made a million dollars you could use timeliness that one works really well so just like slapping the current year at the end of your title is like one of the best ways to get people to click that is most effective starting in like as early as like November to like November December it's like super effective in January like if you're I don't know when this is gonna come out but if you're planning your content like have all of your tutorials and like have all of them in January and use in 2023 in every single one and like just really pile on the in 2023 just use that strategy as much as you can in the early part of the year because every single month it's just gonna get worse like you know it's if it's like August if you publish a video that says in 2022 it's like okay like 2022 is old news right it's August it's been 2022 for eight months but like you know towards the end of the year okay now people are starting to think about ooh 2023 it's gonna be like a you know you're kind of like Trend jacking um you know newsjacking Trend surfing whatever you want to call it but it's going to be on everybody's mind so and also people like clicking on numbers so it's just like a it's a great thing to do for ranking in search you can also um include an objection you might be like uh how to get how to get stronger without lifting weights yeah right like someone's like oh man I don't wanna I don't want to lift weights but I do want to get stronger um cool I'll do that or like you know how to get hot without stopping your ice cream habit yes they're like how to get a six-pack without counting calories like boom oh that was so great I want to hear if there's anything on your mind that you have a hunch about and you're starting to research but you don't have enough data to back it up I want some some spicy give me some spicy take size to something you believe but you'd have you don't have any data to back it up yet oh so we talked about one earlier is I think that people should not use the word and in uh in titles so did you see I think it was like the writers of South Park so like the like easiest secret to write a good story is to like just use the word butt no we found out this really simple rule that maybe you guys have all heard before but it took us a long time to learn it but we can take these beats which are basically the Beats of your outline and if the words and then belong between those beats basically you got you got something pretty boring what should happen between every beat that you've written down is either the word therefore or but right so so what I'm saying is that you come up with an idea and it's like okay this happens right and then this happens No No it should be this happens and therefore this happens but this happens therefore this happens uh because there's like some conflict yeah yeah exactly but I think and it's kind of like uh dilutes a story at least in a title like when you use the word and you're saying oh cool this is about more topics than one so yeah that that is what I think I don't know if that's true or not but uh yeah I think like the more I think you know don't use the word and just make everything about one single subject another thing we could talk about is like the art versus the science of a thumbnail of a title the science is like just like modeling right so we can talk about okay cool I'm starting a new channel I'm gonna be in uh Fitness and I know that like everybody wants to um you know how to how to get a six-pack without counting calories like boom that's it's kind of science right it's like it's proven everybody makes a video or like five best chess exercises or something so science is just like modeling but then you have like the art of writing a good title and that is uh something that I'm like personally working on like really hard but I think that comes to one like being clever and two knowing your audience so one example of like the art of writing a good title is uh Leon hendricks's title uh how this dumb product made a million dollars So yeah so there's contrast between like dumb product a million dollars and that's art right like like boom like he that's very well worded you're using contrast and contrast builds a lot of curiosity but it's so much harder to teach the art rather than science I think I've kind of like studied uh this the science of writing titles really well but uh I think there are a lot of people that just have like a natural like talent for the art of writing titles much better than me so I'm trying to step up my game there but you know that is just something to uh something to kind of like you know think about and like you know if you're looking to like write a title or hire someone to write titles like you know just thinking about the art of it and also the art is like knowing your audience too so you could say how to make money online or you could say how to make ten thousand dollars a month online that's speaking to like your audience's deepest desire and um you know because a lot of people like beginners like that's like the magic number is ten thousand dollars a month if you can uh word your audience's deepest desires like better than they can then like they're way more likely to click so yeah just like the art the art and the science is uh two two interesting things um that need to kind of play around with and then there's also we talked about topic uh so the idea there's the title there's a thumbnail but there's also the Creator many people are getting this wrong as like people aren't answering the question of why should I listen to you and I got this from Alex ramosie if you can prove that you know what you're doing by like telling your stories or your experience then you are going to have way more success than somebody who is just kind of like uh just sharing what they read yes exactly I don't know like what it is about that but like people can just kind of feel it right you can just if you're listening to someone or reading someone's or like you know watching them they just feel that like you know what you're talking about you've done that you've been there versus like oh you got like really nice video and like it looks cool and like your editing is great but it's just kind of like repeated like stale content so I think that so many people are messing that up like they're they're not they're not giving their audience a great reason to listen to them they're not proving to them that they have been in the trenches and they've accomplished what your audience is trying to accomplish I think that's one thing that's holding a ton of people back I absolutely love diving into Data

"Okay, so if you can write an engaging script
for your YouTube video, viewers will watch your video for a longer duration, which can
increase video watch time, views, and overall engagement by 10 times. But if there are so many benefits to writing
a good script, then it is also a very challenging task that many YouTubers struggle with. Some can't write a good intro, some end up
with boring scripts, and some find it difficult to start writing a script altogether. So, welcome to the YouTube Script Masterclass. This is a detailed guide where I'll explain
step by step how you can write an engaging script for your YouTube videos from start
to finish, so that the audience will stick to your video, and your audience retention
will significantly improve. Even if you are a complete beginner who has
never written a script before, after this video, you'll be able to write scripts like
a pro. I will show you examples from my videos and
explain how I wrote their scripts. I will also provide some common tips about
writing scripts. So, let's begin. RESEARCH
Okay, if you can't start writing a script, then the main reason behind it might be that
you don't do enough research, and you start writing the script word by word directly. This is not the right way to write a script
because you don't have a set of information in front of you that you can use to generate
ideas and write the script. To research, the first step is to decide the
topic of your video. For example: How to Write YouTube Titles with
ChatGPT. Now, whatever the topic is, I first write
it as a heading on top of the page. For research, I recommend using a diary or
a copy because while researching, you will have many ideas in your mind, and if you write
them down on paper, you can express them better. After writing the topic of the video, now
it's time to write all the sub-topics in bullet points that you will explain in your video. For example: I needed to explain how to write
titles with ChatGPT, so I thought about the individual topics to cover in it and started
writing them down one by one. Like: the first point was whether writing
titles with ChatGPT will get more views. The second point was how to write titles with
ChatGPT, like what are the prompts, etc. And the third point was how to customize those
titles according to the YouTube algorithm. In this way, you need to mention all the sub-topics
that will come under the main topic. Similarly, for my video on 5 mistakes that
YouTubers make, I did the same: wrote the main heading and then listed all the sub-topics
in bullet points like wrong niche, bad audio, poor branding, etc. After writing these main points, I left enough
space so that I could write the sub-points under each main point. For example, under the first point, which
is wrong niche, I wrote sub-points like why YouTubers select the wrong niche, the disadvantages
of the wrong niche, and how to select the right niche, etc. Keep writing all the important sub-points
that come to your mind. Keep doing this, and you'll see that you have
written your research in a structured format. Now, see how easy it will be to write the
actual word-by-word script based on this research. But if you want to make a video based on just
these bullet points, congratulations, your script is ready. WRITING:
Okay, till now, what we have written is the research work. Now, let's talk about how to write the actual
script. If you have some basic knowledge about scripting,
you'll know that a YouTube script mainly has 3 parts: the intro, the content in between,
and the end with the call-to-action (CTA). The content part is the most important, of
course, because if you don't provide value in your video, what's the use? But even if you write the best content, if
your intro is weak, people will leave your video in the beginning. That's why, when I write a script, if I spend
10 hours on it, I spend 2-3 hours just on writing the perfect intro. For an engaging intro, you should keep in
mind that whatever you write, it should make viewers want to continue watching your video. This is called an intro hook. There are many ways to write an intro hook,
so I'll tell you 3 of them: No.1 & My Favorite: Hook people by talking
about their situation. Basically, you need to think about who your
video is targeting (meaning who is your target audience) and then think about which problem
you are solving for them (meaning what). Then, you need to say something related to
that problem that will make your video's target audience relate to it. For example: I have a video called Increase
Subscribers on YouTube By DOING THIS. Now, the target audience of this video is
YouTubers whose problem is that their subscribers are not increasing. So I thought about something like this for
the intro: Here's the word-by-word translation of the
YouTube script in English: "So, as you saw, I tried to say something
relatable at the beginning of the video, which made viewers connect with the video, and this
made them feel that because I know their problem, I also have a solution to that problem, which
hooks the viewer! You will see the same thing in many YouTubers'
intros. For example, take a look at Algrow's community
post video. The target audience of this video is YouTubers,
and their query is how to use community posts. Now, see how, by paying attention to these
things, an emotion of FEAR is cleverly created in the viewers' minds in the intro of this
video. [Video plays] It is not necessary that you always solve
the viewer's problem in every video. For example, if you are making a documentary
about a person, what problem will you solve in that? In that case, you can use hook no.2: Make
them curious. Basically, you have to make the viewers curious
by creating a question in their minds. For example, see Dhruv Rathee's video on the
theory of evolution at 28 seconds: [Video plays]
As you saw, Dhruv Rathee sparked a very good question in the viewers' minds, which hooked
them. Hook no.3: The Story Method. If there is one guaranteed method to hook
people, it is by telling a story. That story can be a real-life incident, a
fictional story, or anything, as long as it is related to the video's topic. So, again, there is no fixed formula for writing
an intro that you have to follow, but what I have mentioned are common elements in all
of them, and that is to grab the viewers' attention, intrigue them, or create an emotion
like fear, anger, or urgency in their minds. Now, another thing is that no matter how you
write the intro, make sure it is always under 90 seconds and ideally under 30 seconds. After you have written the intro hook, now
it's time to write the middle part, which is the content. Now, since we have already done the research,
writing the rest of the script will be easy because we already have the points; we just
need to elaborate on them. For this, let's take an example from this
video, which is "5 mistakes new YouTubers make." In this video, point no.2 is "bad audio,"
and I have already written its sub-points. Let's now convert it into the actual word-by-word
script. So, as you can see, the first sub-point is
that "audio is the most important thing for YouTube." I could have started directly with the first
line, saying, "Dosto audio kharab hai to use jaldi fix kro because audio is important,"
but that would have been quite boring, and the message I wanted to convey to the viewers
would not have had the same impact... So, see how I started this point: "An new YouTuber has to work on many things
in their initial days, such as lighting, audio, camera quality, editing, and much more. But if you ask me which one is the most important
among them all, I will say 'Audio.' I cannot stress enough how crucial good audio
is." Now that I have mentioned that audio is important,
in the 2nd sub-point, I have to explain why it is important, right? So, here I have also explained it: "Any viewer
can watch a low-quality video with mediocre editing if the audio is good. Whereas, the reverse is not true." And finally, the 3rd sub-point is "how to
fix bad audio," and I have also explained it: "Like I said earlier, 'What if you don't
even have a microphone? How do you record good audio without one?' Well, I have explained how you can record
good audio even without a microphone... You can pause the video to read it in detail." So, in this manner, you have to elaborate
on each point based on your research. And, of course, don't expect perfect lines
to come to your mind right away, especially if you're a beginner. It will require some patience. Also, when you write scripts, do it on some
digital platform; for example, I write my scripts in the notes app on my phone. This way, if you need to make any changes
later, you can do it easily. Now, try to create a connection between the
different points you explain in your video. This will greatly improve your storytelling. For example, in my video about "How to Write
Titles with ChatGPT," there are 2 points. The first one is "how to write titles with
ChatGPT," and the second one is "how to alter the raw title to make it a good title according
to the YouTube algorithm." To connect these two points, I wrote, "Now
that you have found a title in step 1, the question is, should you use that title or
not? This is where step 2 comes in: 'Altering the
Raw Title.' This way, the impact of my video's message on the viewers is greater,
and of course, audience retention will increase. So try to create a question related to the
next point in the viewers' minds before you start talking about a new point. This way, they will find the answer to that
question in the next point. In this way, you can connect different points. After you have written the content part, finally,
we come to the CTA, which is Call to Action, meaning an action that you want the viewer
to take towards your channel after watching your video. You can tell viewers to like the video, subscribe
to your channel, or leave a comment. You can do all of this, but the best CTA on
YouTube is to ask viewers to watch another video of yours by using end screens. To smartly incorporate end screens into your
script, you have to give viewers a reason to click on them. So, whatever topic you are making a video
on, find another video on your channel that is related to that topic and think about what
you can write there to send viewers to that other video. For example, in this video, "Increase Subscribers
on YouTube by Doing this," where I give 4 tips about increasing subscribers, at the
end, I wrote, "Alright, you got the 4 tips to grow your subscribers, but what if you
are not getting any views on your channel? In such a case, chances are you are making
some common mistakes that every new YouTuber makes. I mentioned views here, and then I wrote,
"If you want to know about these mistakes, click on the video on the screen." And then, on the screen, I had my 5 mistakes
video in the end screen. So, you have to think smartly about what you
can say that is related to your current video, and you
can then use end screens there. IMPORTANT POINTS
Okay, so you have learned how to write a script; now let's talk about some important points
that will help you in writing the script. First is to use the right language to connect
with your audience. When writing the script, make sure that the
words you use or the language you use is suitable for your target audience. For example, I know that my target audience
is mostly young people, so I use light and friendly words, and I also write my script
in a mix of Hindi and English because I think my target audience can relate to it the best. Second is to be disciplined. When we write a script, many times we don't
get the right ideas or words. In such a situation, most people get frustrated
and start procrastinating, like opening Instagram and watching reels, etc. But you shouldn't do that. You have to decide a time for writing the
script, and during that time, you should not get distracted. Even if you don't have any ideas or words
for the script, you have to sit and think. The longer you think about the topic, the
more ideas your brain will generate related to that topic. So, focus is very important. Once you get focused in the beginning, you
will achieve a flow state, and generating ideas will become easier for you. Third, take your time and avoid perfectionism. I'm sure many of you are complete beginners
who have never written a script before. I remember 2-3 years ago, when I wrote my
first word-by-word script, it took me about 4-5 days to write a script for a 5-minute
video. I'm not saying it will take you the same amount
of time, but it's quite common for beginners to face this challenge. So, take your time and avoid perfectionism. Fourth, focus more on the first half of the
video than the second half. If a viewer starts watching your video and
completes the first half, you don't have to do much to grab their attention in the second
half. Because, capturing the viewers' attention
requires more effort in the beginning. Once a viewer is halfway through the video,
even if your video is not that engaging, most people who have made it that far will watch
the entire video. So, I'm not saying you can write anything
in the second half, but I'm saying that your focus should be more on the first half
of the script. Alright, you have made it this far, so comment
"SCRIPTING IS NOW FUN," and if you liked the video, please give it a like. Also, if you want to learn editing in detail
like me, click on the video on the screen. I'll see you there, bye!"

====== Estudo_Especialista_151_YouTube Thumbnail Psychology Breakdown2 ====== 
I'm about to reveal our 20 best performing thumbnails of all time and we use this exact same thumbnail psychology to generate over $100,000 for cold em wizard if you want to see that case study it's going to be linked in the top right and it's going to be in the description but I'll get right into it before I go into it though don't steal any of my thumbnails okay I had to go as far as watermarking all of these because people steal these on Twitter it's crazy so first things first Sab subie he's a shark on Shark Tank Australia plus founder at King Kong so here for this thumbnail what we did is we said buy my course please on the right because he was essentially reviewing somebody's coar funnel and then we gave him a bit of a surprise look and then we also put a f minus and some red to really stand out the reason why we put the F minus there is just because he had a lot of things to change in his funnel overall it was good but there was definitely some recurring themes that he had to change one more thing I want to say is that we have four words in the thumbnail the reason why we did this is because if you have four words or less in your thumbnails they'll perform better right ideally you get them as close as you can to zero so next Daniel Fazio co-founder at client Ascension and multiple soft software companies so here what we did was super smart we essentially put a whole sentence in the thumbnail by only using one word steps right so here if you look at this you can clearly tell what the title is about it's three steps to get to 50 CA the method we use to put this entire sentence into a picture is this so pay attention three is just a number right it's not a word so it doesn't count so you read it from left to right so you like three steps and you're obviously going to read three steps first because it's the biggest thing in the thumbnail so it goes three steps and then the next thing you look at is the stripe screenshot cuz it goes crazy so then we say 50 c mon on it and then we also had like some really cool colors going on it really stands out compared to every other thumbnail on his channel and then we also put a green graph showing how his companies are growing over time and then he's also holding a microphone and it's a very high quality picture of them so it just looks insanely professional if you see someone with a microphone you usually think they're important so that's the exact strategy we used here super simple and yeah that's what we did next one here this one we tried to use zero words so what we did is he was explaining demand generation versus like demand capture offers so what that means is like either you're bringing more people into the funnel or you're like converting the people that are already in there so we used icons to show this these were cooking and they still cook so basically if you look at this you won't really know like what the hell he's talking about so you're going to want to click the video and see what these icons mean but if you look at this thumbnail and then you read the title it'll kind of make sense so next in this thumbnail we basically use that same green graph and then we also took Ean gaz's background you can tell by the light and then we added five icons which basically represented the five things he talked about in the video which was the macroeconomics of online business or the economics of online business something like that and he looks insanely serious right he looks like cool composed he's like explaining something the reason why this works is because people see these icons and they're like what the hell is this and then they associate these icons with success because they see the green graph in the background so they just want to watch it right we also had a little bit of red going on on the Contour and on his hair so it look pretty cool and yeah next one this is playing again on that same concept of bringing in an entire sentence into a thumbnail so we were like how to go from 0 to 50K a month and we put a timeline right so you look at this it's like you know what the thumbnail is about right you see a timeline in between his hands you see Zero you see 50 c month These are nice 3D like things in the background Nobody Does that like us so it instantly popped and that video did super good and it booked a ton of calls so next one here is going to be client retention so once again we're using four words or Less in this case we use two words and then you already know what the video is about it's like how to increase client retention got some Stars here to show positive feedback and then he looks super serious he's like counting something so that was pretty cool and then we used a bright background because when you use bright backgrounds it actually makes a significant difference versus dark background so we were doing some split testing see what's up and the light background did better so next is Luke balar this is for a live stream so basically it was a Q&A between Zack Schubert and Luke Belmar so we circled in the background net worth and we xed out some certain things this thumbnail cooked like Zach posted this on his Instagram and everybody was like yo what the hell and yeah I also signed a client off of this thumbnail so somebody saw it and was like yo we need to work together so yeah I already know this thumbnail Cooks unfortunately I don't have data for it because the video isn't public at the moment but yeah next kaib is one of our clients founder at scale clients. 411k month marketing agency so here we're talking about how to use chat gbt to sign clients and also how to use chat gbt for your Facebook ads targeting so we also did another video related to AI we were like how AI automation agencies are a scam this one cooked we also ranked it in search it was going like fourth video in the search bar at one point I think it dropped down towards like seven or eight now but yeah this this one cooked and then here D Rich we're using that same concept of four words or less in the thumbnails and also high quality pictures of the client so here we use numbers to show our outbound system is generating thousands of dollars a day so he's also on the phone so you can clearly see he's making an outbound dial so everything clicked together next thumbnail I love this one cuz Dylan just looks hilarious he's like smashing a laptop so it's like broke you know you're raging and you're making 5 CS from home and then he's on the phone so like it just looks like to make 5 cth you just have to take phone calls which is exactly true he places appointment centers and he also trains them and he places closers so yeah he's basically training people how to become sales reps from home and this thumbnail did really good this is like one of the better performing videos he's had in the last year and then next one this is basically Dylan's story from how he went from $0 per month to 100 C month usually we don't make these sorts of faces with our clients but these were already pre-shot when we onboarded Dylan so he had like his mouth open but it matches up with the theme of the video how it's sort of surprising you know going from $0 per month to 100K month not many people can do that right so next we have Barry Burns founder at top do trading he teaches people how to trade so here we like stop being unprofitable you know you're making 1.2k and then here it's like boom plus 23k and then we also had another one that's like how do you know it's time to quit your job so in instead of putting the word job on the thumbnail it's like we're putting the word into a picture right somebody with a tie he's obviously working a job right and then next is Eddie Chang this one was super good it was essentially just quitting the rat race this one cooked and cuz you know he's in like a hamster wheel and then here he's saying how he regretted going to school you see how we're essentially just taking Concepts and putting them into picture form right so here we're talking about how to start a business with $0 if you look at the thumbnail you won't really get that whole like the whole idea of the video but once you look at the thumbnail catches your attention and then you read the title it all Mak sense right and then next we're talking about how he scaled an Ecom brand from 40K a month to 300K a month in 30 days right this is one of his better case studies and he's using this to lower his closeth rates all that stuff when prospects are searching him up before sales calls they're seeing this case study and they're like okay Eddie knows what he's doing so next we have Zack shart so basically this was one of the better performing live streams on his channel where essentially we're like you have to sell this now and we blurred out Amazon and you can still tell it's Amazon right but like people want to know you know sell what on Amazon or or is it selling Amazon Services you know so they look at this thumbnail and they're like okay and then they read the title and they're like best smma service to sell right now something like that a lot of people don't know you can sell marketing to Ecom brands that are selling on Amazon so there's like Amazon SEO PPC Etc so he was talking about that and then next this is me this is a case study I scaled a coaching offer from 30k month to 75k month using YouTube and this thumbnail cooked right it's insanely simp simple and we use the same format for all our clients where you have the client on the left or the right and you're pointing an arrow towards them and you say how much they're making per month it Cooks right so yeah if you want to see more case studies I have more on my aligning page which is going to be the first link in the description if you opt in you'll get access to this document with all these thumbnails but I generated over 100k for Daniel fazo I also made an interview with him it's going to be linked in the description and if you want to see how we can help you build YouTube sales funnel was that add 10 to 30 qualified calls every single month where you don't pay you want to hit this link often and watch a 4 minute video so that's it if you enjoyed this video make sure you leave a like And subscribe you also would want to check out this video that's on screen right now that's it peace out

youtube2 आरपीएम वाली कोई कैटेगरी है तो उसका नाम है फाइनेंस इस कैटेगरी पर 1000 व्यूज के बदले आप र से $ तक कमा सकते हैं एंड दिस इज वन ऑफ द मोस्ट हाईएस्ट पेइंग निशस इन youtube1 के पैसा छापना चाहते हो youtube0 निश या कैटेगरी आप चूज कर सकते हैं लेकिन रुको रुको रुको सिर्फ पैसा है इसलिए कोई भी इस नीश पर काम कर सकता है क्या क्या कोई भी फाइनेंस से रिलेटेड चैनल स्टार्ट कर सकता है जी नहीं किन लोगों को फाइनेंस रिश का चैनल स्टार्ट करना चाहिए और किनको नहीं यह अभी मैं आपको आगे बताने वाला हूं उससे पहले बात करते हैं इस के कुछ पॉपुलर चैनल्स के बारे में जो youtube2 की वीडियोस तो जरूर देखी होगी जैसे कि पुष्कर राज ठाकुर प्रांजल कामरा रचना रनाडी अंकुर वारिक फाइनेंस विद चरण ये सारे नाम ऐसे हैं जिन्होंने फाइनेंस की दुनिया में अपना एक अलग ही भोकाल मचा रखा है [संगीत] youtube2 व्यूज पर आप पा से ड लर्स तक बना सकते हैं इसलिए इन क्रिएटर्स की मंथली इनकम देखकर भी आप चौक मत जाना क्योंकि ये एक रियलिटी है ये तो वैसे इतने पॉपुलर चैनल्स है तो इनके व्यूज भी बहुत अच्छे खासे आते हैं उस हिसाब से ये इतना पैसा भी कमा रहे थे लेकिन कम व्यूज पर भी आप अच्छा खासा पैसा जनरेट कर सकते हैं इस निश पर हर महीने बिकॉज ऑफ हाई आरपीएम अब आपके मन में एक सवाल तो जरूर आएगा कि ऑलरेडी इतने बड़े-बड़े लोग इस कैटेगरी में इवॉल्वड हैं और अपना नाम बना चुके हैं तो आप एज अ न्यू क्रिएटर कैसे इस फील्ड में अपनी जगह बना पाएंगे और क्या ये निश ऑलरेडी सैचुरेटेड हो चुकी है जी नहीं आपके नॉलेज के लिए मैं एक चीज यहां पर आपको बता दूं इंडिया में आज भी फाइनेंशियल अवेयरनेस लोगों के बीच में बहुत ही कम है 90 पर से भी ज्यादा लोग आज भी अपना पैसा या तो एफडी में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं या फिर गोल्ड में और या फिर प्रॉपर्टी में और अगर बात करें स्टॉक मार्केट या म्यूचुअल फंड या फिर एसआईपी की तो इंडिया में कितने परसेंट लोग हैं जो आज भी स्टॉक मार्केट या म्यूचुअल फंड में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं ये जानकर आप शॉक्ड हो जाएंगे लेस देन 5 पर जी हां 5 पर लोग ही इंडिया में स्टॉक मार्केट में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं जबकि ग्लोबली ये एवरेज लगभग 30 टू 35 पर है तो आप समझ सकते हैं कि इसमें अभी कितना स्कोप बाकी है और जितने नए लोग इसमें आते जाएंगे उनके लिए नए क्रिएटर्स की जगह भी बनती जाएगी तो सैचुरेशन जैसी कोई चीज इसमें है ही नहीं नए लोगों की नई डिमांड जिसका मतलब है नए क्रिएटर्स के लिए जगह इसके अलावा एक और बात ऐसी है जो आपको बाकी क्रिएटर से अलग कर सकती है अगर आप देखेंगे तो मोस्टली फाइनेंशियल निश के जितने भी पॉपुलर चैनल्स है वो या तो इंग्लिश में है या फिर हिंदी में लेकिन इंडिया बीइंग सच अ डावर्स कंट्री रीजनल लैंग्वेजेस में आपको इस कैटेगरी का चैनल ना के बराबर या तो बहुत ही कम मिलेगा तो अगर आप इस कैटेगरी का एक चैनल अपनी रीजनल लैंग्वेज में बनाते हैं तो आई एम श्यर आपको इसकी ग्रोथ बहुत ही जल्दी मिल सकती है फिर वो लैंग्वेज चाहे मराठी हो कनाडा हो गुजराती हो या फिर बंगाली या उर्दू सब में बहुत अब एक और सबसे इंपॉर्टेंट सवाल कौन-कौन से लोग य निज पर चैनल क्रिएट कर सकते हैं और इस पर काम कर सकते हैं क्या इसके लिए आपका एक फाइनेंशियल बैकग्राउंड होना जरूरी है जी नहीं आप में से कोई भी इस कैटेगरी का चैनल बना सकता है और काम कर सकता है बस जरूरी होगी एक चीज और वो है आपका अपना पर्सनल इंटरेस्ट इस कैटेगरी में अगर आपको फाइनेंशियल वर्ल्ड में इंटरेस्ट है और आप रेगुलरली इस कैटेगरी की न्यूज़ अपडेट्स वीडियोस देखना पसंद करते हैं तो आप बिल्कुल इसका चैनल भी क्रिएट कर सकते हैं फिर चाहे आप इंजीनियरिंग बैकग्राउंड से ही क्यों ना हो साइंस बैकग्राउंड से हो या फिर कॉमर्स इट डजन मैटर तो कैसे

माइक्रो नेस सिलेक्शन के बारे में आप देखो फाइंस अपने आप में एक समंदर है तो अगर आप एक न्यू क्रिएटर है तो आपको यह पता होना चाहिए कि फाइनेंस के अंदर कौन-कौन सी माइक्रो निशस आती हैं और उन माइक्रो निशस के अंदर भी कौन-कौन सी सब कैटेगरी आती है अब आपको यह कैसे पता चलेगा इसके लिए हम चलते हैं चट जीपीटी पर और चैट जीपीटी को बोलेंगे कि हमें एक फाइनेंस से रिलेटेड लिए हमें पूरी कैटेगरी और सब कैटेगरी के बारे में बताओ और यहां से आपको सारी डिटेल्स मिल जाएगी फंस के अंदर कितनी चीजें आती है कौन-कौन सी कैटेगरी है कौन-कौन सी सब कैटेगरी है ये सब कुछ आप जैसा कि देख सकते हैं पर्सनल फाइनेंस इन्वेस्टिंग बजटिंग रिटायरमेंट ये सारी मेन कैटेगरी चार्ट जीपीटी ने हमें यहां पर बता दी है और उनकी सब कैटेगरी भी बता दी है अब हम शुरू करने के लिए इनमें से ही कोई एक कैटेगरी चूज कर लेंगे बेस्ड ऑन आवर इंटरेस्ट चलिए तो इस तरह आप कैटेगरी तो चूज कर लेंगे लेकिन अब आपको वीडियो आईडिया भी ढूंढना है उस कैटेगरी से रिलेटेड जिस पर आप अपनी वीडियो बनाना चाहते हैं अब देखो वीडियो आइडियाज ढूंढने के लिए यू हैव टू ऑप्शंस एक होता है ट्रेंडिंग टॉपिक्स दूसरा होता है सर्चेबल या एवरग्रीन टॉपिक जिसमें हमेशा ही लोगों का इंटरेस्ट बना रहता है अब ये दोनों ही टाइप की वीडियो टॉपिक्स आपको कैसे और कहां मिलेंगे तो सबसे पहले बात करते हैं ट्रेंडिंग टॉपिक्स की ये वो टॉपिक्स है जो कुछ टाइम के लिए आपको काफी व्यूज दे देंगे जैसे कि 8 दिन 10 दिन या फिर 15 दिन तक इसमें काफी व्यूज आएंगे लेकिन उसके बाद व्यूज आने धीरे-धीरे बंद हो जाएंगे फॉर एग्जांपल यूनियन बजट किसी कंपनी का आईपीओ लॉन्च गवर्नमेंट की कोई नई इन्वेस्टमेंट स्कीम या फिर कोई स्टॉक का एनालिसिस ये सब ट्रेंडिंग टॉपिक्स होते हैं फाइनेंस कैटेगरी में इसी तरह अगर बात करें स सर्चेबल या पॉपुलर

टॉपिक भी डिसाइड कर लेंगे अब बात आती है स्क्रिप्ट की आप अपनी वीडियो के लिए स्क्रिप्ट कैसे बनाएंगे अगर आप एक एक्सपर्ट है तो खुद ही आप अपनी पूरी स्क्रिप्ट लिख सकते हैं लेकिन अब एआई के जमाने में इतना टाइम और एनर्जी भी हम क्यों वेस्ट करें अब आपके पास स्क्रिप्ट के लिए भी दो ऑप्शंस है नंबर वन हम वापस चलते हैं चैट जीबीटी पर अब फॉर एग्जांपल अगर हम ये पर्सनल फाइनेंस वाली कैटेगरी चूज करते हैं अपनी पहली वीडियो

भी एक आईडिया चूज कर लेंगे जैसे फॉर एग्जांपल मैं अभी ये क्रिएटिंग अ बजट वाला आईडिया चूज कर लेता हूं और इसे कॉपी पेस्ट करके फिर से चार्ट जेबीटी को बोलेंगे कि इस पूरे टॉपिक पर एक डेडिकेटेड [संगीत] youtube-dl में कॉपी कर लेना है अब आप चाहे तो स्क्रिप्ट को को मॉडिफाई भी कर सकते हैं अपने हिसाब से और चाहे तो इस स्क्रिप्ट को [संगीत] google-chrome एक्सटेंज youtube4 जीपीटी एंड क्ड इस एक्सटेंशन को आपको

करते हैं और इसमें से कोई भी एक वीडियो को प्ले करते हैं तो जैसे ही आप वीडियो प्ले करेंगे आपको यहां पर साइड बार में ये ट्रांसक्रिप्ट और समरी वाला ऑप्शन साइड में दिख जाएगा इसमें आपको ये व्यू एआई समरी या ये चैट जीपीटी वाले आइकन पर क्लिक कर लेना है और अब आपको ये सेम वीडियो की पूरी स्क्रिप्ट चैट जीपीटी समरा इज करके दे देगा एज यू कैन सी तो इस तरह आप किसी भी वीडियो को प्ले करके उस पूरी वीडियो की समरी चार्ट जीपीटी से बनवा सकते हैं इन लेस दन 5 मिनट्स और फिर उस समरी को एक वर्ड टॉक में कॉपी करके रख सकते हैं और थोड़ा बहुत अपने साइड से एडिशन करके पूरी स्क्रिप्ट क्रिएट कर सकते हैं और अगर आपको समरी नहीं चाहिए एज इट इज ओरिजिनल पूरी स्क्रिप्ट चाहिए तो वो भी आप यहां से ले सकते हैं आपको ये ड्रॉप डाउन वाले ऑप्शन पर क्लिक करना है और इस पूरी वीडियो की स्क्रिप्ट हूबहू आपको यहां पर मिल जाएगी जिसे आप कॉपी करके एक वर्ड में ले सकते हैं अब एक बात का ध्यान रखना कि इस स्क्रिप्ट को आप एज इट इज यूज नहीं कर सकते नहीं तो कॉपीराइट आ सकता है लेकिन आपको इस स्क्रिप्ट को कॉपी करके वापस आ जाना है चार्ज बटी के पास और इसे बोलना है इस पूरी स्क्रिप्ट को रिराइज करने के लिए मैंने अभी इसे हिंदी में रिराइज करने बोला है आप चाहे तो इसे इंग्लिश में रिराइज करवा के इसे फिर google's का काम भी हो चुका है अब बात आती है वॉइस ओवर की अगर आप अपना फेस भी शो नहीं कर रहे और एक फेसलेस फांस चैनल बना रहे हैं तो आप अपनी खुद की आवाज यूज़ कीजिए फॉर वॉइस ओवर इससे आपको अपनी खुद की ब्रांड वैल्यू क्रिएट करने में भी काफी हेल्प हो जाएगी जिससे कि आपको को आगे स्पंस परशिप मिलने में भी काफी हेल्प होगी जो इस कैटेगरी में काफी अच्छी खासी मिलती है अगर अपनी आवाज भी यूज नहीं करना चाहते तो आप 11 लप से एआई वॉइस भी यूज कर सकते हैं इट्स योर चॉइस कंप्लीट तो ये है मेरी पूरी स्क्रिप्ट जो मैंने हिंदी में कन्वर्ट करके थोड़ा बहुत अपने हिसाब से मॉडिफाई भी कर लिया है अगर आपका इस टॉपिक में इंटरेस्ट अच्छा खासा होगा तो आप भी इसे अपने साइड से अच्छा खासा मॉडिफिकेशन भी कर लेंगे और मैंने अभी 11 लैब से वॉइस ओवर भी बना लिया है आप लोगों को दिखाने के लिए तो बस अब स्क्रिप्ट और वॉइस ओवर का काम हमारा खत्म हो चुका है अब हमें चाहिए होगा कंटेंट अपनी वीडियो बनाने के लिए इसके लिए हम चलते हैं फाइनल स्टेप की तरफ जो है canva.com आपको कवा में आकर सबसे पहले वीडियो का साइज सेलेक्ट कर लेना है लॉन्ग वीडियो बना रहे हैं तो हम नॉर्मल वीडियो का साइज ही सेलेक्ट करेंगे इसके बाद ब्लैंक

नेक्स्ट सीन हमें चाहिए रिटायरमेंट प्लानिंग से रिलेटेड तो एलिमेंट्स में फिर से सर्च कर लेंगे और फिर एक दो रिलेवेंट वीडियोस यहां पर ऐड कर लें आपको यहां पर सारी रिलेवेंट वीडियोज मिल जाएगी अपनी स्क्रिप्ट से रिलेटेड तो आप ये इजली ऐड करके पूरी वीडियो क्रिएट कर सकते बस एक बात का ध्यान रखना कि यह बहुत सारे प्रो एलिमेंट्स है तो आपके पास कवा प्र होना जरूरी होगा तो अगर कवा प्र नहीं है तो ले लेना अभी भी ट्रिपल कमो डील जिसमें कवा प्र फॉर वन ईयर एंड कैप कट एंड फम 13 फॉर लाइफ टाइम वाली डील अवेलेबल है तो जिसने नहीं लिया हो वो ं पर डीएम कर सकते है तो बस इस तरह मैंने यहां पर सारे सींस के लिए वीडियोस ऐड कर

====== Estudo_Especialista_34_Editing Hacks YouTubers Use To Hook You ====== 
 I dive deep into some of the biggest craters on the planet's videos and discovered five editing strategies they used to keep their viewers hooked. What you're about to read here will finally help you work out for yourself how much editing is too much editing, as well as which one of these strategies you should actually use. And after this, you're never gonna watch the David Attenborough show again the same, I'm afraid. To the start of editing strategy number one, here's how this whole thing's gonna work: every editing strategy we're going to look at has one YouTuber who rocks the extreme edit and the other who you might consider a little bit more chilled. For our first strategy, we're going to compare the way that Mr. Who's the Boss and Casey Neistat hook you with a really simple (or not so simple) trick.

So let's start with mega editor Aaron aka Mr. Who's the Boss. Is that a question? Mr. Who's the Boss, every video Aaron makes is an editing marathon. There's never a moment of stillness, anyone's listening. He wants you watching, he wants you reading. I sometimes think he wants she dancing. But why reading? Well, it's because when a word pops up on the screen, it's almost impossible not to read it. I mean, you just read this, right? And that's how he keeps your attention. 

Now, to do this yourself, you can use words on the screen that say exactly what you talk about, or just keywords that pop up to reinforce your point. And if you want to go to the next level like Aaron does, you can track him to your movement. Without a little bit of extra magic... B. Give away, you stupid bee. On the other side of the argument, we have Casey and the way he uses text isn't about saying exactly what he's just said, but actually letting the viewers read so they fill in the gaps of the story to work out what he's doing. So let me show you what I mean with this clip. In this video, Casey's off to South Africa and he's talking about how he has to take multiple flights. And when he arrives in South Africa, instead of just saying "to, we're here," the jazz ensues. He points his camera at the text on a sign in the airport and leaves it on there long enough for the viewers to read and fill in the blanks. So he's making the viewer do some work to piece together what is happening, rather than just handing them everything on a plate. And actually, Casey uses text quite a lot, but you wouldn't really feel like he does because it's nearly always physical and filmed rather than typed in and animated, which makes the content feel more authentic and actually essentially not easy to edit, too.

So which style should you use? The real life text or the graphic text? Well, I have an answer for you, but it's going to make a lot more sense when you understand the next four points, because I'm not gonna lie. It's the same answer for these next points, too. So let's move on to battle Ryan Triana and Johnny Harris. So Johnny Harris, if you don't know who he is, is a bit of a YouTube legend because he answered the question that has been keeping you up at night. Why are McDonald's ice cream machines always broken? If you've been in the UK, he would have been knighted for that bad boy. Now, one thing Sir Johnny is known for is his maps. He films them, but actually it's his motion graphics of them. The viewers are really wowed. Boy, they are the video equivalent of butter melting in your mouth. Alright, that is just not as nice as it sounds. And then there's Ryan Tran, and his graphic of a map. This is one of the biggest and most respected YouTubers on the planet, and he made this in a world where Johnny Harris' quality exists. How does Ryan get away with this utter disgrace? Well, a few reasons, but the one I want to focus on can be made clear when I simply switch Johnny's map onto Ryan's video like this. "I'm headed to this tiny little town that's going to allow me to boat to the island. This is not your average Uber ride." You see the problem? Ryan's graphics actually is equally engaging because they're so simple, but more importantly, they match the tone of the rest of his video. It's authentic. And Johnny just couldn't use a crowd like this because you would never trust him. Because it would be the wrong time when talking about a really serious subject like, "Why the ice cream machines won't work?" or "Why do you wouldn't kill us?" That's a better example. All of his credibility would just fly out the window. But it's the same for Ryan. If his videos suddenly took these ultra swish graphics and put them on one of his highly playful videos that he kept basic for a reason, the viewer can lose trust, too. Because they didn't sign up for something super serious. 

Which brings us to the next editing strategy. One most YouTubers probably wouldn't even think they could achieve, but they can. Honest. And I'll prove it to you. I will, I will. Two editors who are battling out are Gorksa and Colin and Samir. So, the problem the average YouTuber has is that it's just them on camera. But why is that a problem? I've actually touched on this in videos before, but I'm gonna go a bit deeper. So name one amazing film that only has one character in it. And don't say "Cast Away". Wilson was a character. And don't say "Two... the silent French film from the 1920s" because I just made. It up characters make stories more interesting because viewers can gravitate towards one a lot more than another. When you double your characters, you double your chance of keeping your viewers interested. But if it is just you, how can you bring in a character? Well, I'm going to show you using editing. This is how Gorks did it: he made himself into multiple people using the Clone effect. I've done this quite a few times in film. With two on the chilled edit side, Colin and Samir have multiple characters in every video because there are two of them. So when they edit, they just make sure they don't cut one of them out. Super basic editing there. But also, they bring in tons of other people to their show, even their second Channel, which is a lot simpler, is designed around characters. Because they host it but get the questions from the audience to then get involved in the comic character. So the chilled edit version of this could just mean you bring in more people, and the extreme edit could make anyone or anything a character. Isn't that right Wilson? Wilson? Wilson, where's Santa? Yo, man. Oh, got me worried. Sorry, man. I just been chilling with my homies. Where did you learn to talk like that? Tom Hanks. B sounds absolutely nothing like that. You've been tripping. Moving on to editing strategy number four. Yeah, four. And this time we're battling out Mr. Who's the Boss and Casey. Again, looks like I got a bit lazy with my research there. No one will notice. Just don't make it too obvious. But maybe there's a reason I use them again. Anyway, let's start by looking at this opening scene from Aaron's video. Look at all that information we have. The numbers down the side, we have Aaron on the right. We have a split screen on the left. There's just so much going on. Meanwhile, in Casey land, we have just one thing at a time. Really, what they're both doing is their own version of this next editing strategy, which is all about showing rather than telling. So, this is like the golden rule for video. The more you show, the better. It builds credibility, intrigue, and it builds story. And it lets the viewers work things out for themselves. The highly edited version of this is designed to be a sensory overload, in the same way the Avengers films are. I mean, look at how much Aaron is just showing us here. It's crazy. And he's like, "Oh, this guy must know his stuff, because there's just tons of info." Casey's approach is, well, he wants you to focus on only the thing that matters. So, in the edit, he has to decide what that thing is, to best show rather than tell, to fill in the gaps of his story. So, remember the text from earlier when he held the shot, so you could read the sign? That was the showing bit. And why I must have used it again as an example in this video. Not because I'm a very lazy man. Which brings us on to our next editing hooks battle, between IREK and Natalie Lin. And if you've not seen Natalie, you're missing out. Let's start by looking at IREK's strategy here. Who's also very good. So, his videos are super fast-paced, energetic, and fun. And one of the things that adds to the whole viewer's experience and helps hooks them is that whoosh, that boom, pressure. Oh my God, the noise. It all adds another dimension, the crazy Avengers style sensory overload, and it helps to build the emotion, the pace, and the excitement that keeps people interested. And it might surprise you to know that those noises, they don't actually exist in real life. Apart from that one time, thank you. But on the chilled editing side, we have Natalie Lin. Those sound effects you can hear right now, well, they do exist in real life, except they don't. I don't want to ruin every David Attenborough show ever for you here, but he also has the same editing strategy as Natalie. The noises you hear in his animal shows, they're not real either. They don't mic up a duck, not after the incident. Now you're never gonna unsee that when you watch some of these shows. But the reason IREK and Natalie use fake sounds that sound real is because of this. If I use this noise on this clip, the viewers will suddenly lose trust and get pulled out of the story. They could even feel a little bit lied to. Because now, these videos are raw and very personal. Clearly fake sounds would burn that trust too, and it would wreck the stories. Having thus, no longer moving on to editing strategy number five. We're gonna battle Emma Chamberlain against entertainment YouTuber, Preston. And this strategy, when you get it wrong, can really do a heck of a lot of damage. So let's start with Emma's use of it. This video has eight million views, and the first four minutes have no editing, other than just a straight cut of her poking her head out of a bathtub. That's it. Preston's channel, we have this. He makes sure that every single second has some kind of movement going on. From the camera movement to transitions to jump cuts. And actually, when Emma does intentionally throw in some edited movement in her videos, it's done in this kind of Cheesy way, where the viewer knows it's supposed to be cheesy. The thing is, her lack of movement is just as an intentional choice as Preston's hype edit, because she wants the main focus to be on what she's saying, not all of the crazy exciting things going on around. Her, she just has to trust that her viewers will want to listen without trying to trick him into it. And to maintain an authentic tone, you can't go and throw in loads of manufactured excitement. And that's actually one of the biggest problems I see with hype editing. People tend to apply it to content that it just doesn't fit with because they think retention is all about editing effects. And it's just not at all. It's a lot more about the way you order your information and the creative ways you work out how to get that message across. So, what kind of editor should you be and which one of these strategies should you use? Well, actually, you should use all of them. Every YouTuber I just showed you, no matter what side of the argument they're on, is actually doing the same thing as their polar opposite. They all use text characters showing, not telling, sound, movement, and these really are the basics to master. So, the thing you have to ask yourself isn't which one do I use, but how do I work out how far I take them? And so you can answer that question for yourself. I'm gonna read you what might be the hottest take on editing of all time, but it's really going to help you pick your side. Recently, this message popped up on my Twitter, and I don't manage to verify it. But either way, it makes my point perfectly. It's supposed to be a message from Casey Neistat where he's talking about making YouTube videos. Now, it's quite a long message. The first half just completely tears into hype editing. But this was the line that I think matters the most for you when Casey says, "The best steakhouses in the world serve their fillet on a plate with nothing else. Shitty franchises cover theirs in sauce to distract you from the fact you're eating dog food." But I actually have a problem with this because I like franchise food covered in sauce. And when I go into a posh steakhouse, I ask for ketchup because who are you to tell me how I can eat my food? You do not have my taste buds. And that's editing. Billions of viewers all around the world will all have different tastes. All you have to do is ask yourself, "What kind of viewer do I have? The billions who love franchise food or the kind they eat their steak raw?" Think about your viewer's expectations when they click the tone you want to create, style like they'll trust with your idol audience. And then just choose a side, edit for them and forget everyone else because no matter which side you pick, someone probably will not like it. So live by the ethos "You do you boo" and you'll be okay without an ethos. But there's actually something else I've not spoken about that makes a really huge difference to your video's tone and energy. And I don't think enough emphasis is put on this because if you get good at this, you could potentially edit less but still maintain energy. So to learn how two gigantic YouTubers use this to build their channel to millions of subscribers, watch this video next because it's good, even though I say so myself. I mean, Aaron actually commented and said it was good too, so the.

====== Estudo_Especialista_47_how to create a killer youtube video (to blow up your channel) ====== 
this is how to design and create a killer youtube video to blow up your channel because one or two or three killer youtube videos have the potential to dramatically change your channel forever look closely because many creators got their big break because they had just one great video go viral but what makes a great video what do these successful creators know that we don't is it the camera they're using is it the editing software do they have better equipment obviously they know something we don't and we need to figure it out because the fastest growing creators in the world know how to blow up their channel which is three or four killer videos good news for us it's actually quite simple and it doesn't require any fancy equipment or film school experience because the process great creators use to design and create killer youtube videos follows a couple steps and this video will walk you through all of them practice this regimen daily for three months and your youtube channel and your life might change dramatically if you're new to the channel welcome because you're home and to be honest we need you subscribers to this channel are youtube creators making the world a better place with their videos and the world needs your positive influence as a creator before you ever touch a camera you need to plan your video and figure out why people will click on your video in the first place because nothing feels worse than if you film edit you make the highest quality video in the world it's funny it's hilarious it's beautiful it's literally perfect except no one wants to click it this likely means your video was an uninteresting idea ooh that sounded way harsher than i expected for example here is one of youtube's featured rising creators take a look at these videos they've done and which one has way more potential to get over a million views and to blow this channel up is it the one about dog park friendly rules in yosemite or is it the one about how they moved full time into an airstream one of these applies to like maybe a thousand people in the world while the other one appeals to a much bigger audience or what about this yoga channel which video has more potential to get over a million views is it ankle mobility exercises or is it going to be yoga for men one applies to a much smaller audience than the other or let's look like a filmmaker channel same question which video has way more potential to blow this channel up and get it thousands if not hundreds of thousands of new subscribers before you ever even think about touching a camera or an editing software do you see how important it is to have a killer idea in the first place but we usually skip the part about coming up with a great idea and just go straight to filming and editing right don't be afraid to spend days or even weeks coming up with killer video ideas because literally anyone with a killer video idea and the skills to execute it will blow up for years when i've worked with youtube channels they always are so concerned about oh how do i publish every week or even every day what most of them never realized until we worked together is that one killer video will outperform 10 average ones you can get way better results with way less effort and just a month ago mr beast literally confirmed the exact same thing with joe rogan livingston video with million views and 30 million views the video with 30 million views usually didn't put in 30 times the effort like they might have put in two or three times the effort and just had a way better idea does that make sense yes and so the idea is so freaking important like you could theoretically most youtubers watching this you could pull triple the views with half the work if you just have better ideas like no joke it's that extreme and so once you realize how important an idea is you just obsess over well how do i get more ideas how to get better ideas for me i sketch out ideas on an app i made called planner vid that way i can take a step back and ask are these killer video ideas does this feel like a 100k subscriber channel listen to that intuition and feel it compare your channel to other successful channels in your niche and note the differences if you're like me when i started youtube you probably had an idea in your head got your camera filmed it edited it uploaded it to youtube and then you realized oh yeah i guess i need a title and a thumbnail so you scrape something together pretty fast and slap it on youtube because after all you made a great video so the title and thumbnail they're not actually as important as the actual video right here that's a self-centered way of creating youtube content you're thinking like you not like your audience look your viewers don't see the great video behind the click all they see is a title and thumbnail that's all they have to go off of if they are intrigued no one will click and your video will get like 12 views all from you smashing the refresh button speaking of smashing buttons now would be a good time to well you know the rest whereas most of us creators will create our title and thumbnail the very last part the best creators in the world do it very first look mr beast and mark roberts start with a title and thumbnail they know that if they can make a killer tnt they know their audience will want to click on that guides their filming editing everything start with the title and thumbnail instead of doing a last so what makes a great title here are some common titles we often see youtubers make life update how to succeed in life if you make a life update video that only applies to a maximum the number of current followers you have so if you've only got 800 subs that life update video is only going to potentially be interesting to a maximum 800 people for a killer video that can blow up your channel we want a video that can interest and intrigue up to 8 million people alright so let's tweak this title just a little or a lot junior software engineer and youtuber a typical day in my life do you feel the difference here do you see how this can appeal to like at least a million people now sure maybe it's still a life update in a lot of ways and stuff but change that title and you can appeal to so many more people now this video on the other hand is way too general and broad and unspecific and it doesn't intrigue me at all let's change it up what to do when you fall short of your goal motivational do you feel the difference in that video these aren't just titles anymore these are killer titles with the potential to blow up a channel now time for the other half thumbnails because you're not creating just a title and you're not designing just a jpeg image you're creating one whole title and thumbnail designed to create interest and intrigue for the viewer to want to click i like to sketch thumbnails on a paper or an ipad alongside a title that way when it's time to pick up a camera or photoshop i already know exactly what i want to create and i'm constantly keeping that holistic view of the video rather than just its individual parts so take a look at these average thumbnails and then compare them with these super successful thumbnails what's the big difference how come people are clicking these thumbnails instead of these ones it's not image quality or aesthetic my guess would be to take a look at the title and the thumbnail as a whole these two thumbnails are just restating what's already in the title there's no like additional interest or intrigue to want to click these two thumbnails on the other hand complement the titles there's a simple title that interests me and the thumbnail creates intrigue yeah i'm interested in a million dollars and i'm intrigued because did noah just go up to random doors and ask i'm interested in learning how to survive falling from a plane and i'm intrigued because i thought the answer was to keep your legs straight keep your legs straight when you hit the water i'll keep my legs straight spike but by stating what i should not do the thumbnail is implying that it does know the answer so now i'm double intrigued i'm gonna click on both of these videos because i'm interested and intrigued here unfortunately i'm not interested in the confusing title nor am i intrigued by the thumbnail that i can't really tell what's going on and this video i'm interested in because i never thought jpeg was horrible and now i'm super intrigued because oh my gosh is that the image quality difference i have to click and learn what i've been doing wrong all these years interested intrigued when planning my title and thumbnail one exercise i like to do is i like to close my eyes and for several minutes i'll keep my eyes closed while envisioning myself going to click on a video to watch it what's making that video feels so intriguing to me that i'm going to click and watch it what is the title and thumbnail of that video i'm seeing and when the title comes to me i type it out and draw out the thumbnail i see and that works about 50 of the time if when i type out the title it just doesn't look right or doesn't feel right to me then i just go through the same process again once you're like 90 sure that your idea and your title and thumbnail are killer then you can get on to actually making the video scripting is what i spend the most time on and when done properly it will make filming and editing easier here's the template i use when scripting and there's a google doc below that you can make a copy of depending on the type of video you're making there's generally three questions that will guide your scriptwriting process when you answer these three questions effectively you can write a killer script if you're making an educational or tutorial video always ask this question first what do you want the viewer to do to get them the result they're looking for then what do they need to feel emotionally to take that action then finally what does the viewer need to know for example when making this video my goal was for you the viewer to make a killer youtube video to blow up your channel and to practice and then you need to feel inspired that you can make a killer video that you can turn your motivation into momentum to do and to feel those things you need to know the minimal process to plan script film edit and grow now i will constantly refer back to these answers that i wrote down because every single line of my script needs to somehow point back to these answers and if it doesn't it gets cut if i were making a gardening tutorial video man i'm really into gardening lately maybe my do feel and know would look like this or if i'm a gaming channel showing off the best speedrun tactics and legend of zelda my do feel and know would look like this if you're making an entertainment video then these are the questions you'll ask instead what's the big interesting idea of the video what does the viewer need to feel while watching then finally what does the video need to include to be entertaining for example if i was writing a script for davey 504 here's how i would answer the questions for him or if i'm isaiah photo here's how i'd answer these questions these answers will guide your entire script writing process every single line of your script should somehow point back to these answers the first and most critical section of the video is the hook and intro too many youtubers think an intro means a branded video sequence look there's a reason netflix lets you skip intros nowadays no one cares intros for the most part just satisfy the ego of the creator they want some fancy brand and intro that helps them feel legit the first seconds of your video need to create congruency between the title and the thumbnail in the intro look the viewer clicked on your video hoping for something so if you can give them exactly what they're expecting from your title and thumbnail odds are they will like and watch your entire video all of that is decided in your hook and intro see how mr b starts this video there's total congruency between the title and the thumbnail and the intro or how isaiah photo starts his video again total congruency between the title and the thumbnail and the intro in the first three seconds of your video you want the viewer to think this is exactly what i was expecting hi it's uh it's me john the editor and so i was sitting here editing this video about to publish it before i realized that for this hook and intro i forgot the most important crucial thing you should know about a hook and intro if you were to do this thing it would ruin your whole youtube career never ever start your hook and your intro to your video like this sup guys welcome back to the channel so glad you're here but first i would just love and appreciate it if you could hit that like button and that subscribe button just it just helps me so much basically just on here for people to help me and now i've wasted about 30 seconds of your time and i haven't helped you i've just asked for you to help me this whole time all right so hopefully that was obvious as to why you should never start your hook and intro like that because why don't instead you figure out what can i give to someone else instead of just trying to focus on you the whole time now i'm going to get back to editing this video so that way you guys can see it very very soon during or after script writing make notes to the site of each section of what visuals you want i typically categorize visuals like talking head close-up punch in on-screen text type animation or whatever makes sense for you realize you'll need multiple revisions and drafts your first draft of your script is not going to be so great but it's so much easier to come back and edit something that's already there rather than trying to get it perfect on your first try this is my biggest struggle but i'm seeing little improvements in myself as i let go of perfectionism and learn to just get out a rough draft without being critical the first draft takes the longest for me but then the second and third drafts take a fraction of the time the more time you spend scripting the less time you'll spend filming and editing there are a thousand greek tutorials on youtube showing you how to film with a phone or a dslr or a gopro or whatever so i'll focus on principles filming should go really fast because now you have a shot list or you're about to i take all the visuals from the script copy and paste them into a spreadsheet then group shots by location i keep this spreadsheet with me when filming then everything goes fast and efficient show don't tell whenever possible use visuals instead of your words for example too many amateurs film a vlog like this good morning so i woke up and then i got a shower and then i brushed my teeth and then i made breakfast i am here about to start my day i'm so glad you guys are here and make sure to hit the like and subscribe button because really it just it just helps me out so much and whatever you could do to help me i would just love that so much you're just chronologically telling us what's happening watch this great example of show don't tell from sam kolder now midway through the shoot i had the idea to add in a match cut sequence focused on the lens of one of the phones so i had built a little custom wooden rig to hold the phones together and captured footage of the phone in a bunch of different locations i ended up loving the final look of it and i'm stoked that i ended up following through with that idea see how sam didn't have to explain where he was going instead of telling us he showed it andre jake makes videos about finance nothing is more boring than numbers and facts and statistics unless you're a nerd like me which is why every single statistic is reparated visually by andrei and broken up occasionally with funny camera stuff think of every possible creative way to show your story start paying attention to other youtubers and what angles and methods they use and just have fun with it hopefully if you did your script right beforehand this filming part went super fast for you editing is one of the most vital parts to any video and along with coming up with the killer idea and a killer title and thumbnail pacing is absolutely critical to a killer youtube video to blow up your channel because when you click on a video what's the only reason you'll stop watching only if it was boring in other words the pacing is off the viewer lost interest and now the viewer is clicking the back button pacing is even more important for youtube than it is for like big screen movies in the theaters because if you pay money to watch a movie you'll sit through it even if it starts to suck but for youtube if i'm bored or uninterested for even like five seconds i'm bouncing and watching something else re-watch your edit over and over and over and over again and pay attention to where you get bored or lose focus those are usually the parts that need to be re-edited or cut completely every single second of your video needs to somehow add value to the viewer lengthy 10-second branded intro cut it out unnecessary dead space cut it out to write is human but to edit is divine why take 20 minutes to get your point across when you can effectively do it in five every story is collapsible to some degree if you can't cut out 10 percent you're not trying very hard i know there's bits of the video you so badly want to have in there but if it doesn't contribute to the point of the video cut it out look even for me there's bits of every video that i make that i think is the greatest thing in the world but here's the thing these videos aren't about me these videos are about you so every single line i say and every shot i show is designed to help you believe in yourself you can make great videos if you want it and you want it badly your youtube success it doesn't depend on where you're from it doesn't depend on how much money you have it just depends on can you get someone to click on your video and to watch or enjoy your whole video i know this may seem like a lot when you first attempt it and it may feel hard so if there's anything you should take away for how to design and create a killer youtube video to blow up your channel it's killer idea killer title and thumbnail and perfect pacing take your time to get these things right and get better results with less effort no long-term goal is sustainable unless you enjoy it the only reason i consistently go to the gym go for long runs eat a healthy diet say prayers and read scripture every morning and keep making youtube videos is because i enjoy the process if planning and creating a youtube video is miserable for you you're not gonna stick with it and if you enjoy the journey and process of designing and creating killer youtube videos you're already a success you don't gotta wait for some future arbitrary subscriber account you're already a success right now the subscriber count yeah that'll come later so to help design and create killer youtube videos i made this web app called plannervid i'm using it for my own channel too and i've got lots of videos planned but what do you guys think of these upcoming videos and the last video got 1700 likes which is nuts so do you guys think we can match that again

====== Estudo_Especialista_64_How to Make a YouTube Thumbnail in 5 Minutes ====== 
is how to make great thumbnails for YouTube in just five minutes let's start the timer here we go the first thing we want to do is get the shot so for this video got a basketball this is my little prop we are making a hypothetical YouTube thumbnail for a video called how to shoot like Steph Curry so I want to actually record this on my phone and I'm gonna not use the self timer I just think it's gonna be easier and faster if I shoot in 4k at 60 frames per second I'm going to hit record and 60 frames per second is going to be more pictures within the second for me to choose from so got my light right here I'm just going to hit a couple poses maybe like I'm shooting the ball I just want to hit a few different angles you don't want to just settle for one and then you can see what looks best later so I'm gonna hit a few more maybe this side okay we have four minutes left a little over four minutes so I'm gonna stop filming here and now I'm gonna open this up and I'm gonna send this over to my laptop so we are going to airdrop this I'm gonna hit next airdrop I'm gonna send this to my laptop where I'm gonna then going to edit on canva thank you very much canva for sponsoring this video and they make it super easy actually to edit thumbnails and I'll show you some of my favorite features here but as the timer is just ticking down I'm gonna open up canva.com hit create a design then we're gonna go to YouTube thumbnail now that this is open we are going to find this uh video that I just sent to myself and from here I'm going to open this up I'm then going to scrub through this and I'm going to find the image that I want to use for my thumbnail so this one looks pretty good the ball is kind of cut off right there so maybe I'll use it right about there but I also hit a few more options so I'm over here and it's ball is kind of shattering my face so I'm going to use this one right here looks perfect so I'm going to go ahead and pause and then scroll rub over oof this is great so now we have a very high quality you know definitely high quality enough for YouTube of a photo for a thumbnail so I'm going to use that screenshot now and pull this into go to my desktop and I'm going to pull this in right here perfect so now with this inside of canva I'm just going to make this a bit bigger I'm going to go to edit photo and this is one of my favorite features in canva is we're going to hit the background removal and it literally just takes a few seconds you can see how clean this looks now we only have two minutes and 15 seconds left so we need to keep going basically what I want to do at this point is add in my background I'll make this a little bit bigger I'm going to add in my background so I'm going to go on Google I'm going to type in outdoor basketball court and from here I'm just going to find a good image that I can throw behind me and something that is pretty simple this one's going to be perfect so I'm going to copy this image I'm going to throw it into canva I'm going to paste it right here and then I'm going to right click and we are going to put this backwards I'm going to send it backwards I'm going to make this a lot bigger and you can see this is already looking pretty cool for just a few minutes spent like this is already looking uh amazing and so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna blur the background to help me kind of pop off the background a bit more more and canva makes it super easy there's these effects down here there's a blur option so I'm going to click blur and from here I can just change the intensity feel like that looks really good so now this is just uh nice and beautiful I'm going to click back on my image and I'm going to go to the adjustments and from here this is where I can change the color I can change the brightness and that's what I'm going to do is see you know the color temperature I can make it a little bit warmer I think that looks pretty good I can change the brightness here I'm going to maybe add in some more contrast I think that's going to look a little bit better a little more contrasty and we can mess around with the saturation maybe actually bring the brightness down just a little bit more and the contrast down just the hair and then once you dial that in I like to add a little bit of sharpness not too much but this just makes it easier to see on YouTube when they're super tiny it's hard to see so with 40 seconds left let me add in some text I'm gonna go to text I'm just going to throw this one in right here and I'm going to change this to shoot like Steph Curry and this is already looking pretty great I'm going to delete this one down here um and honestly this is looking really good I want to change it to White and that looks awesome but we do want to go to effects add in a nice shadow I can change the blur here we definitely want the shadow to be black and this is looking really really cool being a little bit closer bring the transparency up and I can even change it to the font we use at think media which is this one dang this is looking fire with three seconds left this is a really good YouTube thumbnail that we just made in five minutes and it looks really really good so if you want to try canva out make sure you use the link down in the description thank you so much for sponsoring this video I love canva for producing super quick thumbnails just like this so check it out and we'll see you guys in the next video

when you visit the YouTube homepage you guys are bombarded by countless thumbnails crafted by really skilled designers with huge budgets and really making you feel overwhelmed especially if you're a solo Creator like me I was curious about how top creators consistently go viral so I dedicated weeks to gather the most engaging thumbnails surprisingly I discovered that almost all of them can be grouped into just 20 categories number one the shock and awe genre creators like Tyler Aliva have achieved these huge success the effectiveness of such thumbnails lies in their extremeness whether you guys like it or not the YouTube homepage often FS like this amusement park where like the fastest and most thrilling rides grabs all the attention to illustrate this consider two most identical examples videos about being buried alive surprisingly the smaller Channel posted theirs a month earlier and the key difference is that Jimmy's face is just larger and easier to read especially with the Vivid green grass that really stands out especially in the dark mode prefer by 80% of the viewers mod details like this make a huge outcome number two often the most shock value could be from a large amount of something just like a 100,000 bouncy balls or an object that just costs super expensive these thumbnails Place big numbers front and center betting on them getting your attention not surprisingly they are pretty common in the finance space here in a tour of the world's most expensive car you guys noticed to a million communicated the insane price tag another common feature these thumbnails is avoiding perfectly rounded numbers because it's really easy to lose a sense of skill when they are too many zeros number three reaction videos remain highly popular frequently gracing the trend tab with their eye catching thumbnails the common layout involves displaying the content being reacted to while also positioning the Creator's face on either side people like Mr Beast doesn't really bother switching the photo most of the time cuz it's usually the same thing a really interesting Trend I noticed is that podcasters are doing with a react genre like h3h3 who will react to things live only to be edited into highlight Clips these podcasters can pull off really cool and reaction thumbnails that aren't limited to any specific genre creators are around YouTube will react to just about anything number four utilizing quotes and thumbnails is a underrated trick by featuring a quote that highlights The crucial moments from the video viewers instantly grasp on what to expect whether you guys are aiming for humor or providing contexts quote thumbnails are seen in videos like Brian Johnson's video and this is something that's likely to capture way more attention this year take a moment to spot one in your homepage and consider clicking on one of my videos next time number five just like the quotes question thumbnails play a crucial role take the Science Show by Hank Green for instance almost boosting nearly 8 million subscribers despite my intentional interest of science his videos managed to repeatedly appear on my homepage these thumbnails pose a simple question embedding it into the viewers mind compelling them to find the answer by watching the video while it may seem pretty straightforward experien creators know the effectiveness of packaging involving more than just text questions question thumbnails works best when the title Sparks his curiosity and the hook after clicking keeping you guys engaged in wanting more of it I ended up watching the entire video and went to binge a few more videos and by the way guys if you guys want to learn how to repeatedly go viral on YouTube I made a PDF blueprint called the viral video chich Chi which is free for you guys to download the link is in the description below number six what if your thumbnail is the solution and the title is the question I call this title the Jeopardy thumbnail if the question appears controversial or surprising you might be on to something many people believe the incredible health benefits of Sal lamps but veritasium strongly disagrees this video boldly asks do salt lamps even work the thumbnail answers with a no Kurt s go questioning whether you could fix climate change the thumbnail response with a no but there is an aster with it the entire explanation in the video is a clever approach that makes you guys want to watch to get the full details number seven popular YouTubers like lugwig use controversial thumbnails inspired by Beluga these thumbnails based on Discord are distinctive for a few reason reasons firstly their layouts font and colors are easily recognizable to the target audience especially those familiar with Discord in the SE of flashy thumbnails with red arrows these thumbnails offer something that's fresh and recognizable making them stand out on the homepage number eight when establishing a business strong branding is crucial for converting new viewers into loyal ones while everyone should consider their branding when creating thumbnails let's explore a few examples the digital income project stands out with custom 3D renders in high quality Photoshop work maintaining this tronik theme and glow effect these creators use borders to really set themselves apart like Jeff FM who adopts for a simple logo placement at the bottom left and if you're familiar with the CEO diary you likely notice their signature black backdrop white tag and red border these examples showcase the importance of a strategic branding in attracting and retaining viewers number nine CEO diary is along the top performers on the platform excellent in Social acting it's important to recognize the influence of of familiar faces social hacking involves leveraging the likeliness of a well-known individual that your audience recognize the CEO diary effectively utiliz a strategy featuring successful figures such as Cole sprouts Russell bran and also Robert Green however they are not the only one doing this in 2020 airra went viral in a social hacking collaboration with major creators with even less than 20,000 subscribers number 10 Ryan tryan's famous video the world's quietest room features a new thumbnail Style known as the high contrast thumbnail in this format trayon stands out in the orange jumpsuit against the dark room backdrop this makes the image captivating in Tran's subtle expression he avoids exaggerating emotions making it feel and portray authentic this approach has influenced other creators such as arak and also Mr Beast to adopt the same techniques number 11 in this thumbnail by Matt Wolf the text at the top serves as the header hence the term header thumbnail consider using this approach for thumbnails that require this additional cont context through text and this is a popular choice on YouTube particularly when it comes to textual explanations are needed to conoid an image meaning this technique is effective for thumbnails that benefit from a bit more explanation through words number 12 E mark Rober incorporates a header thumbnail in his videos often including Arrow or Circle sometimes both the format typically features this main element with the Creator Often by the frame although it's not really that visible the text and arrow directs the attention to the focal point and another variation involves a group of people wearing this same attire with a Creator standing out in the center all these variations share this common theme of using arrows and circles to guide the viewers attention and I'm not going to lie guys this actually my go-to style for my thumbnails and my other YouTube channels that I manage if you guys want to see how I was able to scale YouTube channels for other people make sure you guys hit the Subscribe button and a notification Bell to stay up Tod dat when I drop my next video 13 thumbnail Transformations like the ones that you guys see here are a widespread and popular format the main concept is to visually convey a progression or change over time tempting the viewers to click and discover the story behind it transformational thumbnails often spark this curiosity because they prompt the viewer to wonder how the change actually occur and somebody that does this really well is John kougan in the history series and these thumbnails kougan effectively uses the transformational format to engage his audience the alert really lies in the viewers that actually really want to uncover The Narrative or the process leading to the final outcome this technique is a common and yet effective strategy as it Taps into our natural instincts to seek stories behind visual Transformations 14 compare two things in side-by-side formats like showcasing cheap versus expensive items is a common practice this types of thumbnails often feature products such as Mac versus Windows or Pepsi versus Coke can attract a broad audience it's a great strategy to engage fans on both sides encouraging them to actually watch and share their opinions in the comments thus boosting the engagement 15 creators often hide video context by blurring the thumbnail known as the unknown thumbnails I noce that YouTube videos that cover like fiber Freelancers tend to use its technique they may include some comparison videos such as cheap versus expensive but it's crucial to not disappoint viewers with uninteresting content when pixelating the thumbnail it's essential to Captivate the viewers early in the video closing the Curiosity Loop in the intro and consistently delivering interesting content throughout the video well-crafted thumbnails just like these can lead to impressive clickthrough rates 16 every thumbnail in this video features this weird strange object inciting viewers to really click and explore Leon Hendrick generated almost 2 million views using this unique thumbnail strategy providing its Effectiveness across various niches for example a coffee Channel also experienced this crazy success by employing a quirky thumbnail showcasing an unusual coffee brewer the key here is making that weird object speak for itself driving curiosity and engagement whether your audience is big or small this unconventional approach of incorporating a weird we object in the thumbnail could capture attention and boost viewerships it's a simple and yet effective technique that keeps viewer curious and eager to discover more 17 thumbnails aren't always focused on just objects sometimes they highlight creators actions to engage with viewers these are called bring along thumbnails featuring the personality based creators just like Emma Chamberlain and her videos centering around her and her activities rather than being something over the top yet she manages to entertains and share her compelling stories even when doing Medan tasks like C her hair captivating the audience surprisingly Casey Nan most viewed video is a bringalong vlog that has over nearly 80 million views 18 a thumbnail should be self-explanatory but adding context is essential successful thumbnails in this category balance between visually engaging and easy to understand many YouTube subreddits feature confusing and cluttered thumbnails which is a common mistake but the key here is to ensure the cutouts are quickly recognizable to the target audience ideally there should be only one essential element for viewers to focus on for example this thumbnail by hdhd highlights Ethan by making him larger than the others effectively separate him from the background 19 of course if cutout thumbnails are a hit the flip side single photo thumbnails are equally as trendy though they may seem straightforward creating them requires a little bit more planning than a usual thumbnail Matt Dila sets a trend with his outstanding thumbnails he skillfully conveys video topics with one image skillfully using items just like a laptop pen paper headphones and a coffee cup to represent productivity this format goes behind the surface gaining popularity for its laser focus reability and also Effectiveness number 20 in 2024 we see this

overlooked and that that is your idea you could have the best video in the world on making little wooden dolls but if nobody wants to watch a video on making little wooden dolls how are you going to get any views during my research I found that most faceless channels that fail have a very self-centered approach to picking ideas they'll think of topics that matter to them or that they find appealing and therein lies their biggest mistake what you want to do instead is pick ideas that people are interested in watching and the best way to find these ideas is to steal them let's get honest you are not creating a faceless channel to express your creativity you are most likely making it because you want to make money and turn it into a passive Revenue source so you want to create videos that will help you do that quickly start by finding as many reference channels in your niche as possible and figure out what topics have worked for them in the past 2 to 3 months ones that have gotten them at least 2 to 3x the views of their subscribe account that is exactly what we did with this video right here and it clearly paid off now once you have a list of potential topics you want to filter that list based on a couple of different parameters number one is there a Content Gap in the videos put out by competitors if you have some information that will be valuable for users but others have not covered it it can be a great idea to start with second is the topic evergreen or trendy trendy topics stay relevant only for a little while like our videos on bulk creating YouTube shorts if you're a beginner and it takes time for you to execute it's better to start with more Evergreen ideas instead and third how quickly can you execute the idea initially when you start your faceless YouTube channel it's a quantity game which means you need to produce videos consistently and produce enough of them to get on the algorithm's radar and get it to start pushing your content out you can't do that if it takes you a month to create your videos that brings us to our second most crucial step creating the packaging for your video that is your thumbnail and your title you could have created the best video in the world but if nobody clicks on it is it really worth the effort for most beginner faceless as creators thumbnails and titles are an afterthought most people will come up with the idea script the video edit the video and just think of a title and thumbnail when they are uploading but if you look at successful faceless channels you will see they have kickass thumbnails for most such channels they don't even have a face on the thumbnail which means the idea needs to be conveyed completely through design by the way there's no harm in putting your own face on thumbnails even if it is a faceless Channel we did that on inv video and it really helped our Channel's growth but if if you don't want to be on camera at all you need to spend time designing your thumbnail and coming up with your title before you even start making your video again go back to your reference channels and look at what kind of ideas have worked well for them there's no need to copy but take cues from how they design and place different elements on the thumbnail where your attention goes when you first look at it and then work from there now when it comes to the title you want to keep the most important information in the first 50 characters and try multiple iterations to see which title generates the biggest sense of four more or fear of missing out and your thumbnail needs to complete the story that you're telling through your title avoid having the same text and the title and the thumbnail design them to complement each other like in these examples you can take the help of in videoos thumbnail maker on the GPD store to generate images and elements for your thumbnails and put these together in Photoshop or canva coming over to step three which is where the magic lies now you have a killer idea and an epic thumbnail and title so people are primed to click on your videos but how do you get them to stay how do you get them to continue watching that can be achieved by your script the way you present your information in the video now there are several different ways to script your YouTube videos but the most successful faceless channels follow this format and once you understand it you can apply it to any video you want most placess videos will see a dip in the first 30 seconds of the video their graph looks something like this the more people stop watching within the first 30 seconds the less your video will get pushed out by by the algorithm so how do you increase the number of people who stick around start with thumbnail alignment your title and your thumbnail set the expectations for your video and if the first 5 Seconds of your intro don't align with those expectations people are going to click away and these initial 5 seconds are crucial check out these intros my faceless Instagram accounts have generated over 500 this is a little compilation of some pretty creepy videos I found on the internet all of them match the expectations set by the tial app and thumbnail and so people know they haven't been misled and so they want to watch further and a very easy way to do this is to have your first sentence match the title next comes your hook the promise you make at the beginning of the video that compels people to stay basically how can you make people curious now popular faceless creators use three main types of hooks one is question hooks like are you tired of your videos getting zero views despite your best efforts second is context hooks where they set the context of the video up front like I started a brand new YouTube shorts Channel and got 40K views in a month and the third is controversial statement hooks or strong statement hooks where Creator say something outrageous to grab attention and then later explain everything like this one right here every day more companies are announcing that they will no longer be requiring a college degree to get a job with them then we have the rest of the intro here you need to give context a about the video while still being crisp and try to exceed the expectations set by your title and thumbnail basically promise to deliver more value than what the viewer initially expected like this intro right here my shorts channel has over 20 million views and many viral videos but my recent shorts aren't really doing well most of them stuck after getting that first a few thousand views now just because the intro is done does not mean that you can skim on the rest of the script if you want YouTube to push your videos you want to retain people in the video for as long as possible you do this by breaking down your content into bite-sized points and then for each point making sure you present the most important piece of information towards the end once you understand how to write a killer YouTube script you can get an AI tool to generate the basic structure and then fine-tune it according to what you know this brings us to the fourth and the final step now most unsuccessful faceless channels out there fail because they're unable to maintain consistency in posting and producing a good Baseline quality of videos the only way to beat this is to have a Dependable system to to lean on when things get tough the good news is that with the Adent of AI creating this system has become easier than ever this makes it super easy for you to get your videos out on time and massively reduces the time and effort needed to create a high quality output let me show you one such AI tool that can be your video co-pilot and can help you get the first draft of your video out in under 10 minutes and from there you get your final publish ready video in another 10 minutes the tool I'm talking about is in video AI it can take a simple text prompt and turn it into a publish ready video in your own voice in under 5 minutes let me show you how I'm going to start by signing into my account on ai. invideo.io and first create an AI version of my own voice simply click on this button down here that says clone your own voice and upload an audio file off your voice on the next page you can simply record this on your phone or your laptop using the script that I've shared in the description below make sure to give nid AI vocal permission to use your voice once you upload your file nid will ask you for certain permissions and then clone your voice in seconds here's mine and it's named Al now let's go back to the homepage and we are going to start creating our video for this I'm going to click on YouTube explainer as the workflow and here I'm going to put in my topic the things Thomas Edison didn't invent but took credit for anyway I'm going to specify the title give it instructions on the intro the tone of voice language and face and then I'm going to share a reference article link within video to pick information from so that the info is accurate from the start next I'm going to choose the voiceover here I'm just going to click on the my voice option and choose the recorded voice I want to use and finally I am going to write what kind of music I want and we are going to hit generate in video will ask me for a few more details on the audience and the look and feel I want for the video and once I select those here is the first draft in just a couple of minutes Thomas Edison the man hailed as one of the greatest inventors of all time had a knack for more than just inventing he had an uncanny ability to borrow ideas put his own twist on them and call them his own from light bulbs to electric chairs the list of borrowed ideas is longer than you might think so buckle up as we unravel the truth behind Edison's so-called inventive streak that actually looks great for an AI generated video but now let's take our learnings from the first three steps and put those into action and edit this video slightly to make it great I am going to start by simplifying the language because simpler languages are more effective in keeping people engaged and for that I am just going to prompt in video using this prompt box right here to do so oh did you know Thomas Edison was known for um taking others ideas and making them his own many people see him as a great inventor but he also had a talent for changing other people's ideas and then claiming them as his own sounds much better doesn't it I'm also going to ask in video to remove any fumbles we hear in the voiceover did you know Thomas Edison was renowned found for adapting others ideas and making them his own many see him as a brilliant brilliant inventor sounds great now I want to make some specific changes to the intro according to what we learned before for that I am going to click on the edit option right below the canvas and here I'm going to choose the edit script option and here I am going to change the intro to make it more crisp to improve the hook and make it aligned with my title and thumbnail now I also going to trim the rest of the script a little bit this took me about 10 minutes or so to do and then I am going to click apply Thomas Edison's name is associated with many titles genius Mastermind invention Thief doesn't that sound so much better similarly if you want to make any changes to specific media clips that are there in the video you can do that using the edit media option here you either upload your own Clips like I uploaded these pictures of edit or you search the stock library for more stock Clips as soon as you click on the new clip it will get placed on top of the original meaning that it has been replaced now let's take a look at our final results Thomas Edison's name is associated with many titles genius Mastermind invention thief in our history books Thomas Edison is considered one of the greatest inventors of all time but the list of inventions he stole is just as long as his actual inventions and today we're telling you about all of those things said that Thomas Edison didn't invent but took credit for anyway let me know in the comments what you thought of this final clip now once you're happy with the results just go ahead and click on export and keep in mind that voice cloning and Watermark free exports are available only on the paid plan which starts as low as $20 a month but given that you get an insanely powerful video editor for the price it's a bargain so go ahead try applying these principles to create your own videos using in video Ai and don't forget to check out this video next to learn how we blew up a YouTube shorts channel in just 30 days

====== Estudo_Especialista_101_I Studied 5,400 YT Shorts to Crack the Algorithm ====== 
I analyzed over 5 500 YouTube shorts across 34 different niches to try and decode the algorithm and figure out the best way to go viral and I want to show you what I found so here's how it all happened so the other day I was scrolling through Twitter procrastinating as usual and I came across this tweet from Paddy Galley now Patty is a YouTube expert who has generated billions of views with a b and worked with huge creators including lord Jimmy and basically Paddy's tweet broke down a massive study that he and his partner did to decode the YouTube shorts algorithm and despite the fact that most YouTube analytics studies make most people feel a little bit like an Edward Munch painting but the findings in this study are actually so profound that it got a huge amount of views and even Elon Musk did A celebratory live stream in 144p just in its honor all jokes aside though this study is actually a real thing so today I want to Deep dive and expand on it so by the end of this video you will have everything you need to know to start making viral shorts that get you you more subscribers make you more money and get you lots of girlfriends so a quick note though even though this video is probably titled or introd something like I analyze 3.3 Billion YouTube shorts to crack the algorithm I want to make it very clear that all the credit and insights for this study are 100 with Patty and his team I didn't have anything to do with it I just needed a clickable YouTube title so please don't sue me Patty anyway with that out of the way let's get into this because this is fascinating stuff now this study had five massive findings that will help you get more views with your shorts but before we can get into those you need to actually understand a little bit about how the YouTube shorts algorithm actually works and the best way to understand this is from the perspective of a viewer so if you're a viewer opening up YouTube shorts for the first time ever what YouTube's gonna do because it has no data on you it's gonna send you random General popular shorts that's going to measure which ones you engage with so which ones you watch which ones you maybe like and comment on and it's going to gradually start to build up a profile on what type of content you'd like then once it has an idea of what kind of content you like is going to explore that Niche for the best shorts in it and we'll talk more about what best means in a second and it's going to try and feed you those shorts because those shorts are going to be more likely to keep you on the YouTube platform for as long as possible binging your life away which makes YouTube money so let's say for example whenever YouTube happens to show you a cricket show you really engage with that shot you watch it all the way to the end you like it you comment on it the algorithm is going to take notice of that and eventually it's going to be like hey let's search our YouTube library for other videos of Sports and send them to this person and see if they also engage with them so you'll find yourself getting more Cricket shorts you might get some badminton in there maybe some baseball you know the real like lowest of the low but as we mentioned previously there are probably a lot of cricket shorts and baseball shorts and badminton shorts so how is YouTube know which ones to serve to you so it's going to find the best shorts in those categories and give those ones to you first because those ones are going to be the most likely to keep you on the platform and this is where we can start to get into what best actually means because if we take a step back from this example and put ourselves back in the shoes of the Creator your job is to have your shorts be perceived by the algorithm as the best because that means that your shorts are going to be the ones that are most likely to be pushed to viewers first which means you'll get the Lion's Share of the views subscribers and all that good stuff but instead of me just telling you what the best is I actually want to show you some data on this so here is a spreadsheet full of YouTube shorts data from real YouTube shorts and if some of you are watching this right now I wonder how you can get a spreadsheet of die like this as you come to your channel and you go to analytics and in analytics you find that the analytics that you actually want the data of let's say I just wanted the overview I come to overview I'd click see more it's going to open up a more advanced analytics panel and then you come up here to this download button and you can pick which stats you want to download into a spreadsheet and which ones you don't by clicking on this plus button here and then adding say different columns to your report and then once you're happy with your report you can't appear and you click on this download button it'll export your data so back to as you're about to see this data can give us some really interesting insights so in this shade each one of these roads is an individual short so what I'm going to do is come across to average view duration here which is on average how long did a viewer watch particularly short for and what I'm going to do is I'm going to sort from z2a which is going to order this sheet in a way that the shorts with the highest average view duration are going to come at the top and then the shorts the lowest average view duration will be sorted to the bottom and once we've done that grab the views here so from here I'm going to highlight just down this is a really basic analysis and click down here and grab the average what you can see is that on average the top 26 shorts from this Channel with the highest average view duration have about 3.2 million views on average now if I change this and sort this to A to Z this is going to give us the lowest average view duration shorts with the lowest one having just nine seconds and then I do the exact same thing I grab our top 26 videos and look at the average has plummeted the average amount number of views here is now about seven hundred thousand this channel has some pretty good shots on it so even it's worst short to do pretty well but 700 000 is nowhere near 3.2 million so what this is telling us is that if you have a higher average view duration not just see your short but actually watch it for a long amount of time YouTube algorithm sees that as a positive signal that that sure is a good shot and makes it more likely that that shot's going to be pushed out to more viewers I know this is really basic and obvious stuff but often we're always looking for the hacks and I think we need to start on a foundation of what are the fundamentals that really matter and clearly seeing the data here the average view duration is one of those and Paddy's study also backs this up for example this is a graph that encompasses 33 different YouTube channels across different niches and you can see the averages it looks pretty similar right with shorts between an average view duration of 50 and 60 seconds on average got 4.1 million views think about that so in essence if your short can maintain an average view duration of between 50 and 6 60 seconds especially as it scales chances are on average you're going to get about 4 million views but that's a lot easier said than done so how can you actually do that well our study has some insights in this as well I want to come back to this channel here and show you something else very interesting so if we sort out views again Z to A which is going to give us the top viewed shorts on this channel and if we come across to the duration of this shot so this is an average of iteration this is how long each shot is let's have a look through some of these numbers so we've got 45 seconds 59 seconds 52 seconds 54 seconds we keep going down this list we'll see there's only about three shorts in this entire list that are in the 30 seconds or below and even those shorts two of them are like 37 seconds so they're like close to 40 seconds anyway however if we come into views and we sort this the other way around to the shorts with the lowest amount of views I want you to have a look at this column again look at how these numbers have changed right we've got a number of shorts in the 30 seconds and below I can just see 10 from eyeballing this but in general if you just look over this you can can see that on average the shorts that performed worse tend to be shorter no pun intended than the shorts that are longer and interestingly this is also backed up by Paddy's study as well so you can see on this graph the shorts that Paddy analyze most of them were between 30 and 40 seconds you can see shorts between 50 and 60 seconds performed far better than their shorter counterparts now why is this well again with the caveat that people are actually watching your shots because if you just post a long shot no one watches it then it doesn't matter but a longer short has the opportunity to get more of the Thing YouTube cares about most which you know is high watch time for that shot if you're posting a 30 second short chances are your most engaged viewer will probably watch that short all the way to the end so you'll get about 30 seconds of watch time now some really engaged viewers if you're a little bit sneaky and loop your short might watch your short one and a half times maybe even two or three times but that's the vast minority right on the other hand if you have a short that's double the length so not 30 but 60 seconds most of your most engaged viewers will watch that shot all the way to the end the difference is is an Engaged viewer watching your show all the way to the end on a longer shot gives you one minute of watch time as opposed to just 30 seconds so a way to think about this is that the longer short has the opportunity to get more watch time and a higher average view duration than a shorter shot just inherently it does due to length now obviously there are outliers you can see it in my data for example this shot is one of the worst performing shorts on this channel and it is 51 seconds a reason for that could be as you can see the average view duration for this short isn't actually so great but regardless in general if your content is really high quality you're going to have better results if you create a longer short between 50 and 60 seconds versus a shorter short but we're just getting started here because the study found something really interesting with a stat you might not have ever heard of called vvsa AKA viewed versus swiped away essentially if you go to say one of your shorts through content and then come down to the analytics of it by clicking on say this button and then come across to the reach tab what you'll see is this little box box here how many choose to view which is your vvsa think about it for those of you who know click-through rate for long form videos it's basically like your click-through rate but for shorts because on shorts most people don't really click on them they find them in the shorts feed so one of the big colors for shorts is not how many clicks it can get but rather whether or not people will actually watch it versus swipe away from it so essentially what this measures is the percentage of people who actually watched your short when they came across it in the feed versus the people who'd kind of just landed on it and swiped away from it because they weren't that interested so this is a decent metric to look at if you want to gauge the quality of your shorts hooks whether or not you're able to actually really grab someone's attention the first couple of seconds because if you can't do that you're not going to watch the remainder of the short and they're going to swipe away and that's obviously bad but let's get some real numbers on this now if we come back to our data and we have a look at this column here which is a viewed versus swiped away we just get a quick gauge of it you can see that on average for these lower performing shots the viewed versus swiped away is about 70 so on average 70 of people watch the a short rather than swiping away from it and that's decent which explains why even the lowest performing shorts on this channel still manage to get a large amount of Impressions and Views however if we change this and again we sort by the highest performing shorts what we can see is the viewed versus swiped away stat changes a little bit so now we can say it's gone up 10 and on average it's 80 and that might not seem like a big change but when you're competing against so many shorts and you're trying to be the Pinnacle you're trying to be the best in your Niche so you get served first a 10 difference can be a big difference and the study found some interesting insights on this if we have a look at this graph this is kind of laying out all the different videos and shorts that this study analyzed based on vvsa what you can see down here in this corner if we move across this line you can see that if you have a vvsa less than 40 like chances are your short is not going to get more than 10 000 views on the other hand if you're having a vvsa between 70 and 90 your shorts could be getting hundreds of thousands of views as you can see in this kind of green section here now does just having a high vvsa guarantee that your shot is going to get hundreds of thousands of views not necessarily for example if we come to the channel you're watching right now which I'm going to out myself here but um and we come down to one of the few shorts that I've posted click on it we come across to reach you can see this short has almost 90 percent vvsa and yet this short only has 10 000 views so it's not a guarantee that you're gonna get hundreds of thousands of views but based on the data we can see I would still think it's useful to look at this stat and kind of treat it as a you must check this box in order to have the chance to go viral in other words you can see if you're getting less than 40 vvsa like the chances of you really blowing up are pretty much nil however if you're getting more than that that doesn't guarantee you're gonna blow up but at least the door is open and there's a potential assuming you do some of the things we talk about later in this video and also the things we talked about earlier but with all this being said obviously we can see that the competition for shorts is getting tougher and tougher it's no longer the wild west so a short even worth doing well if we have a look at more data from Paddy's study what we can see here the number of Subs gained per 10 000 views for YouTube shorts versus long form videos and what you can see is really interesting is that audio overall across all of the channels that Paddy studied on average long form videos actually got more subscribers per view than short so per 10 000 views long form videos got 22 subscribers if a short got 10 000 views it was only going to get about 17 subscribers however something that might be important to note here is that on average it's probably going to take you a lot more time to create a long form video than a short so that's kind of something that you'll want to take into account looking at these numbers figure out how long it takes you to create a YouTube show on average how long it takes you to create a long-term video on average and use your own Common Sense assuming you want to do shorts that is as to like whether or not it's actually worthwhile you're doing that assuming your goal is to get subscribers and what about making money we've all seen those videos about how to make ten thousand dollars a day with YouTube shots and you actually go and post a YouTube shot for those of you who are monetized you'll probably have found that your YouTube shorts generate more like 10 cents per day but recently shorts were properly monetized by YouTube and what we can see here in Paddy's graphs are the before and after so before shorts were probably monetized they were earning on average per thousand views about 0.27 cents now however after monetization they only got 0.061 cents which is more than double the amount they were earning previously now it's still nowhere near that of a long form video which is pretty easy for a long form video to be you know between one to two dollars per thousand views in some niches it can be way higher than that but what we can see is that shorts are making more money than they once were chances are hopefully this number is going to continue to go up again look at these numbers how much YouTube shorts make on average per thousand views then look at on average how much long-form videos make per thousand views which again is different on every Niche but could like as a baseline you could look you know between one to two dollars per thousand views and again figure out how much time it takes you to create shorts and how many views your shorts get versus how much time it takes to create long form videos and how many views they get and then work out for yourself which ones are giving you the best test Roi the return on your time invested and you can see Paddy also expects that shorts will start making more money in the next few months but I highly doubt they will ever Challenge long-form videos but still again just work out your numbers so I hope this information was helpful for you again padding his team of Legends here for putting together this study so big thanks to him but if you want to

एलिमेंट्स पे बेस्ड होते हैं ये एलिमेंट्स का यूज़ करके क्रिएटर्स अपने थंबनेल को इतना कैची बनाते हैं कि व्यूवर्स क्लिक किए बिना नहीं रह पाते चलिए एक-एक करके मैं आपको ये सारी कैटेगरी समझा देता हूं क्या आपने कभी सोचा है सेलर्स खुद को पायरेट से कैसे बचाते हैं या फिर यूएस का प्रेसिडेंट एक जगह से दूसरी जगह कैसे घूमता है अपनी गाड़ी को कन्वो वैन में डाल के या फिर एयरप्लेंस को कैसे टेस्ट किया जाता है मुर्गे की कुर्बानी देके यह सारे थंबनेल शॉकिंग है जो कि व्यूवर्स को एक सेकंड के लिए सोचने प मजबूर कर देते हैं और इतना क्यूरियस कर देते हैं कि वो अल्टीमेटली थंबनेल पे क्लिक कर देते हैं मिस्टर बीस के मैक्सिमम थंबनेल्स ऐसे ही होते हैं जितना बड़ा उतना अच्छा नंबर्स की बात कर रहा हूं एक 20 मिलियन डॉलर के ट में क्या होगा यह जानने का मन सबका होता है सेम वे में हर मिनट में $ कैसे कमाए यह जानने का मौका भी कोई नहीं छोड़ना चाहेगा इवन इमान गाज के मैक्सिमम थंबनेल्स इसी कांसेप्ट को फॉलो करते हैं इसलिए उसकी वीडियोस इतना चलती है लोगों को इतना ज्यादा एडिटेड और आर्टिफिशियल चीजें देखने की आदत हो गई है कि जब इस तरह के सिंपल थंबनेल देखते हैं तो उनका दिमाग इस चीज को प्रोसेस ही नहीं कर पाता एज अ रिजल्ट क्रिएटर्स को कुछ इस तरह के व्यूज मिल जाते हैं यानी कि आज के टाइम में आप कह सकते हैं सिंपलीसिटी गेट्स अटेंशन क्वेश्चन पूछो और आंसर बताए बिना भाग जाओ रियल लाइफ में ऐसा करोगे तो लोग आपके पीछे पड़ जाएंगे जवाब जानने के लिए और [संगीत] youtube0 में कोई बड़ा क्रिएटर दिखा दो काम बन जाएगा ठीक इसी थंबनेल स्ट्रेटेजी का यूज करके मैंने अपने चैनल को स्टार्ट किया था और मिस्टर बीज के नाम से तो जितने भी चैनल्स चल रहे हैं सब यही कर रहे हैं और ये चीज एक्चुअल में कितनी इ एक्टिव है ये खुद ही गेस कर लो दोनों में से कौन से थंबनेल पे क्लिक करोगे मेन कैरेक्टर को किसी बड़े ऑब्जेक्ट के अंदर रख दो या फिर पास में रख दो और व्यूज मिलियंस में ग्रंटेड है क्योंकि ऐसी चीजें हमें नॉर्मल अपनी लाइफ में देखने को नहीं मिलती है और अगर आपकी फीड में एकदम से कुछ ऐसा आ जाए तो बिना सोचे आप क्लिक जरूर करोगे ये वन ऑफ द मोस्ट कॉमन यूज थंबनेल डिजाइन है बेसिकली थंबनेल के टॉप पे एक टेक्स्ट लिख दो जो कि आपके टाइटल से लिंकड हो मेरी मैक्सिमम वीडियोस जिन्होंने अच्छा परफॉर्म किया है उनमें यही डि डिजाइन यूज़ किया गया है यह चीज आज से 5 साल पहले भी वर्क कर रही थी और आगे भी वर्क करती रहेगी कुछ भी कंपेयर कर दो चीप वर्सेस एक्सपेंसिव ए वर्सेस आओ जनवरी वर्सेस अप्रैल एंड सो ऑन और आपको व्यूज आते रहेंगे अब अगर आपको लग रहा है कि आपको थंबनेल्स की कैटेगरी पता चल गई है तो आप भी किसी एक कैटेगरी को फॉलो करके खुद के थंबनेल्स पे क्लिक ले आओगे तो आप गलत हो क्योंकि बड़े क्रिएटर्स ऐसा नहीं करते हैं उनको सारी थंबनेल्स कैटेगरी पता होती है और वो लोग इसे मर्ज करके अपने थंबनेल्स बनाते हैं जिसकी वजह से उनके व्यूज सीधा 10x हो जाते हैं मिस्टर बिस्टो इवन अपनी हर वीडियो के 10 थंबनेल्स बनवाते हैं और $100 से भी ज्यादा सिर्फ थंबनेल्स पे ही खर्च कर देते हैं क्योंकि वो हर एक स्टाइल को बनवा के देखते हैं लेकिन आपको इतनी मेहनत करने की जरूरत नहीं है अगर आपको डिजाइनिंग पर्सपेक्टिव समझ आ गया तो आपको बनाने से पहले ही पता होगा कि किस तरह का थंबनेल वर्क करने वाला है और फिर अब बस आपको उसे क्रिएट करना होगा नाउ डिजाइनिंग के अंदर मैं आपको बेसिक चीजें नहीं बताने वाला कि कंट्रास्टिंग कलर यूज़ करो थंबनेल को सिंपल रखो वर्ड्स कम इस्तेमाल करो ये सब ऑलरेडी आपको हर कोई दूसरा यूटर बता ही रहा होगा और बोल-बोल के आपका सर भी खा चुका होगा तो क्वेश्चन आता है कि डिजाइनिंग में हम लोग सीखने क्या वाले हैं कंपोजिशन का मतलब होता है कि आपके थंबनेल का ओवरऑल सेटअप कैसा होगा यानी कि कौन सा एलिमेंट कहां जाएगा और कैसे लगेगा वई लेआउट का मतलब होता है उन एलिमेंट्स को बैलेंस करना और स्पेसिफिक एलिमेंट्स की अरेंजमेंट करना ताकि कंपोजीशन ना बिगड़े नाउ इसके अंदर तीन-चार चीजें आती है जो कि मैं आपको सिखा देता हूं अगर आपको नहीं पता रूल ऑफ थर्ड क्या है तो मैं आपको बता दूं कि ये कांसेप्ट फोटोग्राफी में सबसे ज्यादा यूज किया जाता है इस रूल के अकॉर्डिंग आपको अपने कैनवस को थ बायथ के सेगमेंट में बांट देना है कुछ इस तरह से और जो भी आपका मेन एलिमेंट है या फिर पर्सन है या फिर फेस है उसे लाइन ऑफ इंटरसेक्शन पे रखना होता है ताकि फोटो के अंदर एक डेप्थस आए और एक फील आए आप किसी भी बड़े यूट्यू को देख लीजिए वो इसी रूल को अपने थंबनेल पे फॉलो कर रहा होगा तो मेक श्योर आप भी इस चीज का ध्यान रखें वरना आप भी कुछ इस तरह की गलतियां कर दोगे अब आपने कभी सोचा है कि थंबनेल्स में हमेशा फेस या पर्सन लेफ्ट साइड में क्यों होता है रीजन यह है कि हम थंबनेल्स को देखते नहीं है बल्कि आंखों से पढ़ते हैं और हमारी आंखों को लेफ्ट राइट पढ़ने की आदत होती है इसलिए आपको हमेशा अपने मेन एलिमेंट को लेफ्ट साइड में रखना है और सेकेंडरी एलिमेंट को राइट साइड में बेसिकली जो चीज आप चाहते हैं कि ऑडियंस पहले देखे उसे लेफ्ट साइड में रखना है थंबनेल के अंदर आपको मैक्स टू मैक्स तीन से चार एलिमेंट्स ही रखने हैं उससे ज्यादा नहीं जितने कम एलिमेंट्स होंगे उतना ही अच्छा मेरे मैक्सिमम थंबनेल्स जिन्होंने अच्छा वर्क किया है उनमें तीन एलिमेंट्स ही थे और मिस्टर बीज की मैक्सिमम वीडियोस में तो सिर्फ दो ही एलिमेंट्स होते हैं जिनमें से एक तो उसका खुद का फेस ही होता है मुझे एक डिजाइनर ने एक बात सिखाई थी जिसने मेरे थंबनेल को क्रिएट करने का पर्सपेक्टिव ही चेंज कर दिया अच्छा थंबनेल वो नहीं होता जिसमें ऐड करने के लिए कुछ ना बचा हो बल्कि वोह होता है जिसमें रिमूव करने के लिए कुछ ना बचा हो जिस तरह कोई भी ड्राइंग या आर्टवर्क को डायरेक्टली नहीं बनाया जाता है ठीक उसी वे में थंबनेल को भी डायरेक्टली नहीं बना सकते उसको लेयरिंग करके ही बनाना होता है यानी कि आपके पास एक फोरग्राउंड होगा मिड ग्राउंड होगा और एक बैकग्राउंड होना चाहिए और ये तीनों चीजें बैलेंस्ड होनी चाहिए आपस में भी और ओवरऑल थंबनेल में भी अब जिनको नहीं पता उनको बता दूं फोरग्राउंड वो चीज है जो सबसे सामने होगी बेसिकली हमारा मेन कैरेक्टर या फिर एलिमेंट मिड ग्राउंड वो चीज है जो बीच में होती है यानी कि सपोर्टिव टेक्स्ट या एलिमेंट एंड बैकग्राउंड तो बैकग्राउंड ही है इसको तो क्या ही एक्सप्लेन करूं इसके सिवाय लेआउटिंग में आपको थोड़ी और चीजें ध्यान में रखनी है जरूरी नहीं है कि आप हर बार मेन एलिमेंट को सेंटर में रखो बल्कि मेन चीजों को साइड में रख के आप सेकेंडरी एलिमेंट को शो कर सकते हो जिससे आपके थंबनेल में एक डायनेमिक फील आएगा नाउ कंपोजिटिंग एंड लेयरिंग के बाद आता है डिजाइनिंग का अगला कांसेप्ट जो कि है कलर्स अब आपको हर कोई ऑलरेडी बता चुका होगा कि कंप्लीमेंट्री कलर्स यूज करो ब्लैक के ऊपर वाइट रखो वाइट के ऊपर ब्लैक रखो कलर व्हील के अपोजिट कलर्स का इस्तेमाल करो रेड के साथ ग्रीन लो ब्लू के साथ ऑरेंज लो एंड सो ऑन बट द पॉइंट इज ये सारा काम हम कर क्यों रहे हैं कंट्रास्ट बनाने के लिए राइट नहीं ये आधी इंफॉर्मेशन है जो आपको पता है डिजाइनर्स कलर व्हील का यूज करते हैं सिर्फ कंट्रास्ट बनाने के लिए नहीं बल्कि एक कलर पैलेट बनाने के लिए जो कि वो लगभग अपने हर थंबनेल में यूज़ करते हैं लेकिन कलर पैलेट बनाते कैसे हैं वैसे तो कलर व्हील में आप इन छह पैटर्स को फॉलो करके एक कलर पैलेट बना सकते हो लेकिन अगर आपको इतनी कॉम्प्लेक्शन में नहीं जाना है तो मैं आपको एक इजी मेथड बता देता हूं जिससे आप खुद का एक कलर पैलेट बना सकते हैं सबसे पहले आप एक मेन कलर चूज कर लीजिए जो कि आपके चैनल को रिप्रेजेंट करने वाला है ये आपका फोरग्राउंड कलर होने वाला है एग्जांपल के लिए मैं यहां पे ब्लू चूज कर लेता हूं और इसके बाद आपको तीन कलर्स ऐड करने हैं ब्लैक ग्रे एंड वाइट क्योंकि ये कलर्स आपको कंट्रास्ट देंगे जो कि आपको चाहिए और हर थंबनेल में इन कलर्स की जरूरत तो पड़ने ही वाली है और आखिर में आपको अपना सेकेंडरी कलर चूज करना है जो कि कंप्लीमेंट्री होना चाहिए आपके मेन कलर का और ये चीज आप कलर व्हील में देख सकते हैं एंड बूम आपका कलर पैलेट तैयार है अब कलर्स के बाद आते हैं डिजाइन के अगले एलिमेंट पे जो कि है टाइपोग्राफी थंबनेल की टाइपोग्राफी में आपको ज्यादा कुछ समझने की जरूरत नहीं है सिवाय इसके कि आपको सेन शरिफ फ्ट्स का यूज करना है शेरिफ का नहीं शेरिफ फ्ट्स डिजाइंस के लिए यूज होते हैं यानी कि अगर आप मैगजीन बना रहे हो या कुछ लग्जरियस टाइप दिखा रहे हो तब आपको इसकी जरूरत पड़ेगी बट अगर आपको लोगों का ध्यान खींचना है आपको कुछ बोल्ड दिखाना चाहिए जो कि आसानी से पढ़ा जा सके वो भी जितना जल्दी हो सके उतना जल्दी तो इसके लिए सें शरिफ ही बेस्ट है जिस वर्ड को एमफसा इज करना है उसको बड़ा रखना और टेक्स्ट को उभारने के लिए स्ट्रोक या शैडो का यूज करना टाइपोग्राफी में आपको इससे ज्यादा कुछ भी सीखने की जरूरत नहीं है आपके लिए इतना ही इनफ है थंबनेल बनाने के लिए नाउ आपको थंबनेल्स की कैटेगरी पता है एंड थंबनेल्स बनाने के लिए आपको जितनी डिजाइनिंग आनी चाहिए थी उसकी भी पूरी थोरेट्स के आईडिया सोचने में तो वो कैसे करते हैं क्या हम यूटर्स के पास कोई स्पेशल ट्रिक है जिससे हम थंबनेल्स के आईडिया सोचते हैं नहीं बिल्कुल भी नहीं बल्कि हम सब बहुत ही बड़े चोर हैं हां आप लोगों ने बिल्कुल सही सुना हम सब एक दूसरे से चोरी करके अपने थंबनेल से आइडियाज लेते हैं यकीन नहीं हो रहा तो मिर बीस का ये थंबनेल देख लो जो कि इस थंबनेल से चुराया गया है रक का ये थ थंबनेल देख लो जो कि मिस्टर बीज से चुराया गया है या फिर मेरा ये थंबनेल देख लो जो कि एआई गाय ने चुराया या फिर ये वाला थंबनेल देख लो जो कि डिकोडिंग वाइटी से इंस्पायर्ड है लेकिन क्या ये एक्चुअल में चोरी है नहीं इसे इन्फ्लुएंस होना कहते हैं या फिर इंस्पायर होना बोलते हैं आर्ट की दुनिया में कोई भी चीज ओरिजिनल नहीं हो सकती हर चीज किसी ना किसी चीज से चुराई गई है या फिर मॉडिफाई की जाती है इस बात को अच्छे से समझने के लिए मैं आपको स्टील लाइक एन आर्टिस्ट बुक रेफर करूंगा बट द पॉइंट इज अगर हम दूसरे के थंबनेल से आईडिया ले भी रहे हैं तो उसे अपने आईडिया में कैसे बनाएं या फिर उसमें चीजें ऐड या रिमूव कैसे करें ताकि लोगों को ये ना लगे कि पूरा का पूरा कॉपी पेस्ट ही कर दिया है आंसर सिंपल है वही काम करो जो स्कूल में किया करते थे असाइनमेंट को पूरा करने के लिए और टीचर से बचने के लिए क्या स्कूल में आप सिर्फ एक ही बंदे से अपने टेस्ट या समर वेकेशन का काम कॉपी करते थे अगर हां तो आप गधे हो क्योंकि कॉपी हमेशा दो-तीन लोगों से करना चाहिए ताकि आसानी से पकड़े ना जाओ सेम वे में अगर थंबनेल का आईडिया चाहिए तो सिर्फ एक ही निश में ही क्यों घुस रहे हो बाकी निशस भी तो youtube0 है कि जिस तरह आपको पता है कि जो थंबनेल वर्क कर रहा है उसी को कॉपी करो उसी तरह आपके कंपीटीटर्स को भी ये चीज पता है एज अ रिजल्ट आप सब लोग लगभग सेम थंबनेल बना बैठोगे जिसकी वजह से ऑडियंस हो सकता है आपकी वीडियो ना देखे लेकिन अगर आप अपनी नीज से बाहर के आईडिया उठाते हो तो वो चीज हर एक के लिए अलग होने वाली है इवन अगर आपके कंपीटीटर को यह बात पता होगी तो भी ना के बराबर चांसेस है कि आप दोनों सेम निश में सेम थंबनेल से इंस्पायर हो जाओगे ऐसा नहीं होगा एज अ रिजल्ट वैरायटी बनी रहेगी तो दूसरी नीश से आईडिया कैसे लेते हैं और थंबनेल बनाते कैसे हैं और मेरा थंबनेल बनाने का क्या प्रोसीजर होता है अब मैं आपको ये सारी चीजें दिखाने वाला हूं वो भी प्रैक्टिकली और ये सब मैं आपको का नाम सुनके वीडियो बंद करने वाले अभी के अभी रुक जाओ अगर आपका सपना एक बड़ा यूबर बनना है तो आपको काम भी बड़े यूटर की तरह करना पड़ेगा और मैं किसी बड़े यूटर को नहीं जानता जो कि बैठ के कैनवा या पिक्सल्स में अपना थंबनेल बनाता है आपको प्रोफेशनली वर्क करना पड़ेगा और अगर आपने जिके बाद ओपन होते ही आपके सामने कुछ इस तरह का इंटरफेस आ जाएगा जहां नीचे के साइड आपको आपके प्रीवियस प्रोजेक्ट्स दिख जाएंगे अगर आपने नया-नया ही साइड में आपको काफी सारी डिटेल्स दी गई है जो कि आपको फिल करनी है जो डिटेल्स मैंने यहां पे फिल कर रखी है वही डिटेल्स आप अपने फाइल्स एडिट्स विंडोज एक्सेट एक्सट जो कि आपको एकल और वड जैसे प्रोग्राम्स में भी मिलती है उसके बाद लेफ्ट हैंड साइड में आपको आपका टूल बार दिया गया है जिसका यूज करके हम कुछ भी बना सकते हैं ठीक microsoft's दिए गए हैं तो सबसे पहले अगर आप कंट्रोल दबा के अपने माउस व्हील को स्क्रोल करते हो तो आप अपने कैनवास को लेफ्ट या राइट भेज सकते हो कुछ इस तरह से बेसिकली आप अपने वर्क स्पेस में मूव कर सकते हो वहीं ऑल्ट दबा के अगर आप स्क्रॉल करते हो तो आप वर्कस्पेस में ज़ूम इन या ज़ूम आउट कर सकते हो जितना चाहे उतना अब अगर आप नया-नया ही फोटोप सीख रहे हो और हो सकता है कि गलती से आपने अपने वर्कस्पेस को मैस अप कर दिया कुछ इस तरह से और चीजें इधर-उधर हो गई है तो आपको डरने की जरूरत नहीं है आपको बस टॉप में यहां जो विंडो लिखा गया है वहां पे जाना है और देन वर्कस्पेस में जाके रिसेट एसेंशियल्स पे क्लिक कर देना है जिसके बाद सारी चीजें अपनी ओरिजिनल पोजीशन पे चली जाएगी नाउ यहां लेयर्स में आप इस प्लस वाले आइकन पे क्लिक करके नए लेयर्स को ऐड कर सकते हैं और जिनको नहीं पता कि लेयर्स क्या होते हैं और ये कैसे काम करते हैं उनको मैं थोड़ा सा समझा देता हूं यहां टूल बार में आपको काफी सारे टूल्स दिए गए हैं जिनमें से सबसे पहला टूल जो मैं इस्तेमाल करूंगा वो है ब्रश टूल आप अपने ब्रश का साइज यहां से बढ़ा सकते हैं और उसकी हार्डनेस को भी कंट्रोल कर सकते हैं और यहां कलर पे क्लिक करके आप कोई भी रैंडम कलर चूज कर सकते हैं नाउ जब मैं कैनवास पे ब्रश रन करूंगा तो आप देख सकते हैं कि ये ब्रश मेरे लेयर वन पे चल रहा है बैकग्राउंड अभी भी बिल्कुल साफ है वहीं अगर मैं एक और लेयर ऐड कर दूं और फिर कलर चेंज करके दोबारा से ब्रश को चलाऊं तो यह ब्लू कलर रेड कलर के ऊपर आ जाएगा इसका रीजन यह है कि ब्लू कलर वाली लेयर रेड के ऊपर है अगर मैं रेड वाली लेयर को ब्लू के ऊपर रख दूंगा तो रेड कलर कैनवास में ऊपर आ जाएगा जैसा कि आप देख ही सकते हैं इस आई वाले बटन से आप अपनी लेयर्स को अपनी मर्ज के अकॉर्डिंग हाइड भी कर सकते हैं अब मैं आपको सारे इंपॉर्टेंट टूल्स बता देता हूं जिसका आप इस्तेमाल करने वाले हैं तो इसमें सबसे पहला है मूव टूल जिसको यूज़ करके आप अपने कैनवास में चीजों को मूव कर सकते हैं आपने जो भी लेयर सेलेक्ट की होगी उस लेयर के एलिमेंट्स मूव होने लग जाएंगे कुछ इस तरह से इवन मूव टूल का इस्तेमाल करके आप एलिमेंट्स की साइज को को बड़ा छोटा भी कर सकते हैं और अगर आपको दोनों लेयर्स को एक साथ मूव करना है तो आपको बस पहले किसी एक लेयर पे क्लिक करना है और फिर कंट्रोल दबा के दूसरी लेयर पे क्लिक करना है जिसके बाद दोनों लेयर्स सेलेक्ट हो जाएंगे एंड मूव टूल से आप इन दोनों को एक साथ ही मूव कर सकते हैं डजन मैटर यहां पे कितनी लेयर्स है जो जो आपने सेलेक्ट किया होगा वो सब कुछ मूव करेगा नाउ अगला टूल है सलेक्शन टूल अगर आप कैनवास पे कोई सलेक्शन बनाते हैं और फिर किसी लेयर को सेलेक्ट करते हैं जिसके बाद मूव टूल का इस्तेमाल करते हैं तो सिलेक्टेड पार्ट आपका मूव होने लग जाएगा बाकी चीजें नहीं होगी आप कंट्रोल प्स डी डबा के चीजों को डी सेलेक्ट कर सकते हैं अगला टूल है हमारे पास लासो टूल ये टूल भी सिलेक्शन का ही काम करता है लेकिन इसमें आपको काफी सारे सब टूल्स मिल जाते हैं जैसे कि मैग्नेटिक लासो टूल जिसे आप बिना ज्यादा मेहनत किए किसी भी कॉम्प्लेक्शन को सेलेक्ट कर सकते हैं आपको बस स्टार्टिंग में क्लिक करना है और फिर अपने माउस को शेप के आसपास घुमाना है और ये अपने आप ही सलेक्शन बनाता चला जाएगा शेप के अकॉर्डिंग लासो के नीचे आपको मैजिक वन टूल दिया गया है जो कि कलर के बेसिस पे सिलेक्शन बनाता है इवन आपको हर टूल के ट्यूटोरियल्स खुद एडो भी प्रोवाइड करता है आपको बस स्टार्ट करना है अब इसके बाद यहां पे जो भी इंपॉर्टेंट टूल है वो है इरेजर इरेजर का साइज आप अपने कीपैड में इस वाले बटन से भी बड़ा छोटा कर सकते हैं आपको डिलीट का बटन यहां मिल जाएगा जिससे आप डायरेक्टली लेयर्स को डिलीट कर सकते हैं अगर कोई इमेज कैनवास में इंपोर्ट करनी है तो बस उसे ड्रैग एंड ड्रॉप करो और वो खुद कैनवास पे आ जाएगी जिसे आपको यहां पे कंफर्म करना है और फिर इसको आप अपने मर्जी के अकॉर्डिंग चला सकते हो कंट्रोल t दबा के आप किसी भी चीज को छोटा बड़ा कर सकते हो लेकिन ये एक सिमेट्री वे में होगा यानी कि हर जगह से वो इक्वली इफेक्ट होगा लेकिन अगर आप कुछ ऐसा करना चाहते हो तो आपको शिफ्ट दबा के कोई भी एक कोना पकड़ लेना है और फिर उसको स्ट्रेच कर देना है और आपका काम हो जाएगा अगर गलती से कोई गलती हो जाती है तो आप कंट्रोल z दबा के उसे अनडू भी कर सकते हो नाउ आई होप आपको तो इसके लिए सबसे पहले मैं आने पे मुझे एक और थंबनेल मिला जो कि छोटे चैनल पे भी वर्क कर चुका है तो इसे भी मैं सेव कर लूंगा इसके बाद मुझे एक और थंबनेल मिला जो कि थंबनेल से रिलेटेड टॉपिक पे तो नहीं था लेकिन उसमें एक सेंटेंस काफी क्लिकब्रिक्स करने का पोटेंशियल रखता है अब मुझे काफी सारे सिमिलर थंबनेल्स दिख रहे थे तो मैं सर्च बार में जाके टाइटल को थोड़ा चेंज कर दूं गा और दोबारा से स्क्रॉल करना स्टार्ट कर दूंगा नीचे आते टाइम मुझे एक थंबनेल मिला जिसका कांसेप्ट तो अच्छा था और इसे मैं और भी ज्यादा बेहतर बना सकता हूं नाउ मैंने अपनी नीश रिलेटेड तो काफी थंबनेल्स उठा लिए लेकिन ये इनफ नहीं है इसलिए अब मैं दूसरी नीश के थंबनेल्स भी देखूंगा मैं पर्सनली जिस नीश को देखता हूं वो है सेल्फ इंप्रूवमेंट नीश क्योंकि इनकी ऑडियंस लगभग 13 साल से 18 साल की होती है नाउ यहां पे स्क्रॉल करते हुए मुझे हमजा का एक थंबनेल मिलता है जिसे मैं अपने थंबनेल के लिए अडेप्ट करवा सकता हूं तो इसे भी मैं यहां से डाउनलोड कर लूंगा और फिर कुछ रैंडम क्रिएटर्स के थंबनेल देखूंगा फॉर एग्जांपल इमान गाजी इसके चैनल पे दूसरा ये थंबनेल मुझे काफी अच्छा लगा और मैं इमेजिन कर सकता हूं कि ये आईडिया मेरे थंबनेल के लिए कैसे यूज़फुल है तो मैं इसे भी डाउनलोड कर लूंगा नाउ मैंने काफी सारे थंबनेल्स डाउनलोड कर लिया है ईया के लिए अब मैं करूंगा क्या कि मैं थंबनेल बनाने वाला हूं जो कि इनसे अलग भी होगा लेकिन इनसे इंस्पायर्ड भी होगा नाउ यहां पे सारी बात क्रिएटिव माइंडसेट की आ जाती है मैंने इन थंबनेल्स को डाउनलोड किया है क्योंकि मैं इमेजिन कर सकता हूं कि हर एक थंबनेल को मैं कैसे मॉडिफाई करके अपने लिए नया थंबनेल बना सकता हूं लेकिन वो चीज हो सकता है आपको नहीं दिख रही होगी इसलिए मैं यहां पे एग्जांपल के लिए आपको थोड़ा सा ट्राई करता हूं समझाने का कि मेरे दिमाग में क्या चल रहा है मैं एक youtube1 पे ले आता हूं और आपको अपनी इमेजिनेशन दिखाने की कोशिश करता हूं अगर मैं यहां इमान गाज की जगह अपने youtube2 करके तो भी एक एक अच्छा खासा थंबनेल बन जाएगा या फिर यहां पे अगर मैं आइक की शक्ल की जगह अपना youtube2 के साथ तो वो भी काफी अच्छा थंबनेल दे देगा लेकिन वो चीज कहीं ना कहीं कॉपीडब्ल्यूबी जो कि मेरे थंबनेल के लिए होने वाली है अब पर्सनली मुझे ये टाइटल और कांसेप्ट ज्यादा अच्छा लगा तो मैं इसे ही रीक्रिएट करने की कोशिश करूंगा लेकिन मैं अपने थंबनेल में इतना ज्यादा एमटी स्पेस नहीं छोड़ने वाला तो मैं करूंगा क्या कि सबसे पहले मैं बैकग्राउंड तैयार करूंगा तो मैं अपने यहां टूलबार में जाके सबसे पहले शेप टूल में जाऊंगा जहां पे मैं रेक्टेंगल को चूज करूंगा और फिर यहां ऊपर फिल्म में जाके डिसाइड करूंगा कि रेक्टेंगल के अंदर कौन सा कलर होना चाहिए मैं अपने थंबनेल्स में मेनली ब्लू कलर यूज करता हूं तो मैं यहां पे भी ब्लू ही देख रहा हूं लेकिन एक नॉर्मल कलर लेने की जगह यहां पे ग्रेडिएंट ज्यादा अच्छा लगेगा जो कि आप यहां से देख सकते हैं यहां पे आपको डिफरेंट डिफरेंट कलर के काफी सारे ग्रेडिएंट पैटर्स मिल जाएंगे तो मैं ब्लू में जाके एक डार्क ब्लू टाइप ग्रेडिएंट ले लूंगा और फिर एक रेक्टेंगल बनाऊंगा जो कि थंबनेल जैसा दिखाई देगा आप देख सकते हैं कि रेक्टेंगल बनते ही इसके अंदर कलर अपने आप फिल हो गया अब अगर आप ध्यान दें तो मेरे रेक्टेंगल के कॉर्नर्स कर्व्ड है स्ट्रेट नहीं है तो ये काम आप रेक्टेंगल को चूज करके यहां से पिंच करके कर सकते हैं जितना ज्यादा पिंच करोगे उतना ज्यादा कर्वी होगा ये चीज को आप यहां से भी कंट्रोल कर सकते हैं वैसे नाउ मैं इन कॉलम्स को जो कि इस लड़की ने यूज़ किया है इससे अपना पूरा बैकग्राउंड बनाने वाला हूं और फिर एक यूनिक थंबनेल बाहर निका लूंगा तो अभी के लिए इस रेक्टेंगल से मैं लेफ्ट साइड की रो बनाता हूं तो इस रेक्टेंगल को मैं कंट्रोल ् c और फिर कंट्रोल प् v दबा के कॉपी क पेस्ट कर लूंगा और अलाइन कर लूंगा नाउ मैंने दोनों लेयर्स को सेलेक्ट करके कॉपी पेस्ट करूंगा ताकि काम आसान हो जाए और ऐसा करते रहूंगा जब तक नीचे तक ना पहुंच जाऊं नाउ आप यहां पे आप देख सकते हैं कि मैंने पूरी एक रो बना ली है रेक्टेंगल से लेकिन ये थोड़ा सा ज्यादा लग रहा है और मेरे थंबनेल को मैस कर सकता है तो मैं नीचे के दो रेक्टेंगल को डिलीट करके बचे हुए रेक्टेंगल का साइज बढ़ा दूंगा कुछ इस तरह से और फिर इस पूरी रो को कॉपी पेस्ट करके मैं ऐसे ही रोज बनाता जाऊंगा जब तक मेरा कैनवास कवर ना हो जाए नाउ आप यहां पे देख सकते हैं कि ये करते-करते मैंने यहां पे कितनी सारी लेयर्स क्रिएट कर ली है इवन मुझे अपना लेयर वाला पैनल पूरा दिख भी नहीं रहा है मुझे यहां स्क्रोल करना पड़ रहा है तो मैं करूंगा क्या कि ऊपर वाले पैनल को थोड़ा सा छोटा कर लूंगा ताकि मुझे सारी लेयर्स दिखाई दे और अगर ये काफी नहीं है तो मैं यहां से इस पैनल को थोड़ा सा डिलीट भी कर लूंगा अब ये सब करने के बाद भी मुझे यहां पे काफी सारी लेयर्स दिख रही है तो मैं क्या करूंगा कि इनका एक फोल्डर बना लूंगा आपको बस एक रो के सभी रेक्टेंगल को यहां लेयर्स में सेलेक्ट कर लेना है और फिर यहां पे क्लिक कर देना है जिसके बाद वो सभी लेयर्स इकट्ठा होके एक फोल्डर में चले जाएंगे और इस फोल्डर का आप अपने अकॉर्डिंग नामकरण कर सकते हैं ठीक ऐसा ही मैं सभी रोस के साथ करूंगा जिसके बाद मेरे पास यहां पे इनफ स्पेस होगी और मैं सभी लेयर्स को एक साथ देख पाऊंगा अब यहां पे जो हमारा बैकग्राउंड है वो वाइट है और वो अच्छा नहीं लग रहा है तो इसके लिए मैं पहले इस लेयर को अनलॉक करूंगा और यहां से फोरग्राउंड यानी कि टॉप का कलर ब्लैक रख दूंगा जिसके बाद मैं शिफ्ट प्लस बैक स्पेस दबा आंगा तो सामने कुछ ऐसा पॉपअप आ जाएगा और ओके दबाने पे ब्लैक कलर पूरे कैनवास पे फिल हो जाएगा ये चीज आप यहां पे देख सकते हैं ना मुझे ये टेक्स्ट चाहिए तो मैं यहां टेक्स्ट टूल को सेलेक्ट करने के बाद टेक्स्ट लिख दूंगा और पूरे टेक्स्ट को सेलेक्ट करके यहां से इसका कलर चेंज कर लूंगा डबल क्लिक करने के बाद आप यहां से फॉन्ट भी चेंज कर सकते हैं इस थंबनेल में सें सफ से ज्यादा सरी फंट अच्छा लग रहा है तो मैं उसे ही यूज़ करूंगा और टेक्स्ट को अलाइन कर दूंगा अपने कैनवास से अब मुझे एक टिक वाला पीएनजी चाहिए तो वो मैं पीएनजी विंग की वेबसाइट पे जाके डाउनलोड कर लूंगा और अपने कैनवास में इंपोर्ट कर लूंगा और उसके साइज को सेट कर दूंगा टेक्स्ट के अकॉर्डिंग नाउ यहां पे मेरे पास अपना टाइटल भी है यहां पे पीएनजी भी है लेकिन ये स्टिल ऊपर वाले पूरे एरिया को कवर नहीं कर रहा है तो मैं इसे थोड़ा सा बड़ा कर लूंगा ताकि ये इजली विजिबल रहे अब ये जो हमारा बैकग्राउंड है ये काफी ज्यादा ब्राइट है और बैकग्राउंड डल होना चाहिए ताकि मेन एलिमेंट ज्यादा इजली देखा जा सके तो मैं सभी ग्रुप्स को सेलेक्ट करूंगा और यहां से उनकी ओपेसिटी को थोड़ा सा कम कर दूंगा अब किसी ग्लिच की वजह से मेरा ये लेफ्ट वाला कॉलम सेलेक्ट नहीं हुआ है तो मैं लेफ्ट वाले कॉलम के ग्रुप पे क्लिक करूंगा और उसके अंदर के सभी लेयर्स को सेलेक्ट करके उनका एक साथ यहां से ओपेसिटी कम कर दूंगा अब मुझे यहां से दिख रहा है कि टेक्स्ट की लाइन में थोड़ी सी गड़बड़ है तो मैं दोनों को एक साथ सेलेक्ट करके उन्हें भी ठीक कर लूंगा अब जिस तरह हमारे रेफरेंस में एक थंबनेल अलग कलर का दिखाया गया है हमें भी वही करना है तो इसके लिए मैं एक न्यू लेयर बनाऊंगा और दोबारा से रेक्टेंगल शेप को चूज कर लूंगा अब आप ये देखिए कि आपका सेकेंडरी कलर जो आपने चूज किया है वो मेरे कैनवास में डार्क ब्लू है तो मैं सके कि कौन सा कलर इसके साथ बेस्ट कॉम्प्लीयंट पे आके रेक्टेंगल के अंदर रेड ग्रेडिएंट फिल कर दूंगा और इस बार एक बड़ा सा रेक्टेंगल बनाऊंगा नाउ मुझे इस रेक्टेंगल को सेंटर में अलाइन करने में दिक्कत आ रही है तो मैं कंट्रोल r दबा के अपने वर्कस्पेस में रोलर्स को ले आऊंगा और ड्रैग करके इससे सेंटर में एक लाइन बना लूंगा जिसके बाद मैं अपने रेक्टेंगल को यहां पे परफेक्टली फिट कर लूंगा अब ये परफेक्ट जगह बैठ तो गया है लेकिन इसका कलर हल्का सा पिंकिश है और मुझे रेड या ऑरेंज चाहिए तो मैं यहां पे इसे चेंज कर लूंगा और आप देख सकते हैं कि अब कितना अच्छा कंट्रास्ट बन चुका है और हमें यही तो करना था एक अच्छा कंट्रास्ट बनाना था नाउ मेरे पास यहां पे काफी सारी खाली स्पेस है तो मैं यहां पे एक हैंड पीएनजी लगा दूंगा और उसे भी पीएनजी विंग से ही डाउनलोड करूंगा नाउ ये थंबनेल पहले से तो अच्छा लग रहा है लेकिन इसमें अभी भी काफी ज्यादा खाली स्पेस है तो यहां पे भी मैं कुछ भरना चाहता हूं हमारे रेफरेंस में यहां पे पूरा एक लोगो और टाइटल का स्पेस था तो हम भी उसी चीज को यहां पे क्रिएट कर देते हैं लेकिन इस बार हमें कलर को ग्रे रखना पड़ेगा तो मैं पहले शेप में जाके सर्कल ले लेता हूं और सर्कल बना देता हूं अब कलर ढूंढने में मुझे दिक्कत आ रही थी तो मैं काम हो जाएगा अब जब मैंने सर्कल और रेक्टेंगल दोनों बना लिया तो मुझे सर्कल की वजह से अपना डिजाइन थोड़ा सा खराब लग रहा था तो उस चीज को मैं यहां से डिलीट कर दूंगा और बचे हुए पूरे स्पेस को रेक्टेंगल से ही फिल कर लूंगा नाउ ये मुझे ज्यादा बेटर लग रहा है और अपने थंबनेल के अंदर थोड़ा सा ज्यादा स्टोरी टेलिंग करने के लिए मैं यहां पे व्यूज भी लिख देता हूं ताकि हमारा काम अच्छे से बन जाए इस वाले टेक्स्ट का फॉन्ट मैं ट्राई करूंगा कि youtube0 हो तो मैं यहां पे अलग-अलग टेक्स्ट के साथ ट्राई करके एट द एंड मैंने ये टेक्स्ट चूज कर लिया है नाउ कहने के लिए तो हमारा थंबनेल रेडी है और सारे बिगिनर्स इस थंबनेल को बिना सोचे समझे अपलोड भी कर देंगे लेकिन एज अ प्रोफेशनल थंबनेल डिजाइनर आप एक चीज भूल रहे हैं वो है शैडोज शैडोज ही थंबनेल में असली जान डालती है क्योंकि वो थंबनेल्स में डेप्थस देती है तो शैडो बनाना कोई मुश्किल काम नहीं है आपको बस ब्रश टूल को सेलेक्ट करना है और ब्लैक कलर चूज करके अपने ब्रश का साइज थोड़ा सा बढ़ा लेना है जिसके बाद आपको यहां से अपने फ्लो और ओपेसिटी को दोनों को कम कर लेना है और यहां से हार्डनेस को भी थोड़ा सा कम कर लेना है ताकि शैडो को कंट्रोल कर सको अब शैडो कौन-कौन सी जगह लगेगी सबसे पहले तो हमारे टेक्स्ट के नीचे तो आपको टेक्स्ट वाली लेयर के नीचे ही एक लेयर ऐड कर लेनी है और फिर हल्का-हल्का वहां पे ब्रश रन करना है जिससे कि आपका टेक्स्ट काफी अच्छे से उभर के बाहर आ जाएगा अब क्योंकि मुझे दिखाना है कि ये वाला जो रेक्टेंगल है ये बाहर आया है पुराने रेक्टेंगल से तो इसमें भी मुझे शैडो ऐड करनी पड़ेगी तो मैं बड़े वाले रेक्टेंगल के लेयर पे जाऊंगा और उसके नीचे एक और लेयर ऐड कर लूंगा और उसके बाद वहां पे भी ब्रश को रन करूंगा लेकिन उसके साइज को थोड़ा सा छोटा करके सेम काम आपको हाथों के नीचे भी करना पड़ेगा डिटेलिंग देने के लिए और आपका थंबनेल अब रेडी है लेकिन एक्सपो सेटिंग में हो सकता है कि आप जब ये थंबनेल अपलोड करो तो आपके थंबनेल के पिक्सेल फट जाए और मुझसे हमेशा पूछा जाता है कि मैं ऐसा क्या करता हूं जो मेरे थंबनेल्स इतने क्रिस्पी होते हैं इतने ज्यादा अच्छे टेक्सचर के साथ होते हैं तो आज मैं आपको वो सीक्रेट भी बता देता हूं आपको चार बटंस एक साथ दबाने हैं कंट्रोल शिफ्ट ऑल्ट और e जिसके बाद आपके पास एक न्यू लेयर होगी जिसमें आपके पूरा डिजाइन होगा इसको सेलेक्ट करने के बाद आपको फिल्टर में जाना है और कैमरा रव फिल्टर चूज करना है जिसके बाद आपके पास आपके थंबनेल के कंट्रास्ट सैचुरेशन टेक्सचर जैसी चीजों को कंट्रोल करने का ऑप्शन मिल जाएगा आपको यहां पे मेक श्यर करना है कि आप टेक्सचर को थोड़ा सा बढ़ा दो और अपने थंबनेल में थोड़ा से ग्रेन दे दो बहुत ही थोड़े से और बाकी चीजें जो जो आपको आपके थंबनेल के अकॉर्डिंग अच्छी लग रही है उसको उस तरह से आप ड्रैग कर सकते हो नाउ ओके पे क्लिक करने के बाद मेरा पूरा थंबनेल तैयार है और इसे अब मुझे बस एक्सपोर्ट करना है तो एक्सपोर्ट करने के लिए आपको फाइल में जाना है और एक्सपोर्ट पे क्लिक करना है जिसके बाद आपको एक्सपोर्ट एज पे क्लिक करना है और जेपीजे फॉर्मेट चूज करके क्वालिटी को फुल कर देना है और ध्यान रखना है कि यहां पे थंबनेल का साइज 2mb से कम ही हो एंड आपका काम हो गया है आप इवन थंबनेल prev.com पे जाके चेक भी कर सकते हो कि आपका थंबनेल अलग-अलग डिवाइस पे कैसा दिखेगा तो ये होता है प्रोसीजर एक थंबनेल बनाने का लेकिन क्या पहली बारी में इतना अच्छा थंबनेल बन जाता है नहीं डिजाइन बनाते बनाते समझ आता है कि आप क्या बना रहे हो फॉर एग्जांपल जो थंबनेल मैंने आपको अभी बना के दिखाया सेम थंबनेल को बनाने के लिए हमने इन डिजाइन से होते हुए गए थे ना नाउ आई नो आप में से काफी सारे लोग सोच रहे होंगे कि थंबनेल बनाना मुश्किल है लेकिन ऐसा नहीं है आपको अगर एडवांस लेवल की एडिटिंग नहीं आती है तो आप थंबनेल टेंपलेट्स भी बाय कर सकते हो जो आपको पहले से ही काफी सारे यूनिक डिजाइंस देता है और उसे आप अपने अकॉर्डिंग चेंज या मोल्ड भी कर सकते हो दिवेश ने एक ऐसा ही टेंप्लेट का बंडल बना रखा है जिसमें काफी सारी निशस के थंबनेल डिजाइंस है और साथ ही मेरे भी काफी सारे थंबनेल्स के टेंप्लेट है तो आप उसकी वेबसाइट प जाक वो बाय कर सकते हैं लिंक मैंने डिस्क्रिप्शन में दे दिया है लेकिन अगर आप मेहनत करने के लिए तैयार हैं तो आप देवेश के चैनल पे जरूर विजिट करना क्योंकि उसने मेरे काफी सारे थंबनेल्स को ब्रेक डाउन किया है और वो काफी ज्यादा डिटेल में इवन उसने

I can make any Niche viral literally any Niche viral that's Patty Galloway the most prolific YouTube strategist in the world and he is here today to address the most common problem hurting smaller channels oh I can't do this because my Niche isn't like that or my Niche is limited because I think so often creators use that as an excuse over the past decade Patty has worked with thousands of channels and generated over 10 billion views and in this video he's going to walk you through the strategy he used to do it including pre-production I was like to say there's three main sources of ideas internal ideas external ideas and then packaging at 20% better title could mean double triple quadruple it could mean a 100 times more views and some hot takes there is no meta thank you to one of 10 for sponsoring this video some of the most common comments we get from people especially when we have videos about how to find more success on YouTube is people will say things like that great but that won't work for my Niche or yeah but I'm operating in this really small audience or that would never work for me so my first question to you is are there niches that are just destined to fail like are there niches that are just too small to make work on YouTube this is honestly one of my biggest uh pet peeves as a strategist as someone that works with so many different channels is people just associate me with you know the biggest creators I've work with um and I sometimes feel like like saying hey like I've worked with hundreds of channels I'm not just like a beast boy I'm not just like a Mr Beast disciple just because I might have worked with him at some point in the past I've worked with channels in so many different niches and I have yet to find a single Niche where I can't get some traction now that traction might look different for different niches you know some niches are naturally smaller I always like to use this term which you know and you've you've heard me talk about before Tam totally addressable Market I like to think about that for YouTube channels and think like how big is the market for something but every time someone has come to me and said hey you know my Niche is too small it's all well and good you talking about all this stuff I don't have all this money my Niche is small I don't have this and that I look at their Niche and it's like a golf Niche I'm like 30 million people play golf every weekend or something like you know there's a there's a lot of viewership in the golf Niche there's there's plenty of room there or it's something like knitting and you know again like go go search knitting on YouTube and filter by most viewed you'll see knitting videos with millions of views so I have yet to sort of find a niche that I don't think has a big enough audience of course there's going to be like some exceptions some examples of things which are just so so hyper Niche that there's only a few thousand people in the world that care about it and in which case maybe in that situation you should look at trying a different Niche but um I really I really hate that um that Viewpoint of oh I can't do this because my Niche isn't like that or my Niche is limited because I think so often creators use that as an excuse to to not actually try harder with their content and not to put the onus on themselves to make great content instead just blaming the market they're operating within it feels like a very disempowering belief like why would you want to believe that there's a low ceiling on what you're trying to do I feel like you should be doing everything in your power to blow that ceiling off what you think you can do so when you think about the The Tam the total addressable Market how do you actually go about identifying or calculating what you think the Tam for a channel might be yeah I love I love thinking about it like that as like a limiting belief because my team will sort of testify this I've you know built a small team around myself over the the last few years and something I always say is like the mindset you have towards content and like the the sort of philosophy you have towards content has a huge impact in what you actually go on to do so like one thing my team will always hear me say is we can make literally any n viral like I can make any Niche viral just give me the topics give me the tools give me the right sort of Direction and I can make that Niche viral and um I think even just like this idea like you talked about of or like we've talked about of Tam like how do you calculate that sometimes people think about things there's a fancy name for it Tam they over complicate it to me it's just about saying well what's our Niche let's just say our Niche is golf let's go to YouTube search golf in YouTube and then in the search filters that you can apply on YouTube this isn't using some like weird paid tool just on YouTube search that term golf um filter it for longer videos so just filter out short so you can actually filter video length in the search filters on YouTube and just then sort by most viewed and what you'll see is for golf you'll see like probably all these huge outliers at the top where there's like some random like you know I know the side men make a golf video that has 34 4 million views that's probably not an accurate representation of how many views there could be for the golf Niche but if you go down a little bit further you see okay here's this Golf Channel that does tutorials there's many videos they have that have a million views here's just so the Golf Channel that does entertainment videos he has like one and two million view videos and before you know you're getting a picture of okay at the very high level the best channels in the space get this viewership that's probably a pretty accurate picture of roughly where your time could be now of course there's some niches that aren't capitalized yet there's some niches that haven't been fully explored and discovered and conquered by creators so there is like more viewership in some of those niches but time to me is just really just seeing what are the best in the niche currently doing views wise like what are they hitting and what am I hitting so before blaming the niche I could look at that and say well if I'm a Golf Channel that's doing like 100,000 views a video which is still great but I'm like my Niche is too small I need to change I need to Pivot well if the best channels are doing a million views of video I'm still like 10% of what I could be doing 10% which is kind of crazy when you think about it and a lot of people that come to me with these things of saying I'm in too small of a niche they the real reality is they're probably a Golf Channel doing 10,000 views a video or 5,000 views a video so that's just generally how I think about it just like looking at what the biggest channels are doing and using that as a bit of a benchmark for what is possible in the niche do you have any examples of channels that they started off narrower than they needed to be and you decided hey let's actually expand the way were thinking about this to have a larger total addressable Market yeah someone someone I do think is a great example of it and it's someone I'm sure you're familiar with is Noah Kagan so when I first started doing some work with Noah Kagan I believe that was 2020 or 2021 and I could just see he was like a really talented entrepreneur he had lots of interesting stories but he was doing like very very Niche things when I thought there was more potential there I thought like he had built a lot of the foundation of what a great YouTube channel needs to be so he had he built a team he had good editing he had like decent thumbnails but the topics he was picking was like you know six tools that help me run my business or how to use slack or how to like which Zoom Zoom versus like Google meets like like these sort of like very Niche business topics um and I went in and I was like what if we just go for bigger swings we go for bigger videos we go for things like you know asking millionaires for advice and you know that's obviously such a huge Trend now but we were doing that like two or three years ago um going going for like really General business videos that we could say to ourselves someone at the very beginning of their Journey who doesn't know what slack even is because they don't even need to think about slack yet because they're just by themselves they can watch this video and enjoy it and then also someone that's a more seasoned entrepreneur can still watch and enjoy it because they'll still find interest in the things we're covering in the video and actually just even going back to this idea of like niches being too limited or like my Niche is boring like even when I was thinking before this podcast I was just some names just came to mind like someone that was actually in the last cohort of uh my accelerator program which is you know this group coaching program I run his name was Andrew millison have a guess what his Niche is like it's the most it's it like the actual Niche itself is so Niche but he gets so much viewership like try to think of the most random Niche you can think of oh my gosh okay I'm going to guess that he does um Eastern dance Trends it's a great guess great guess that is pretty neat and actually sounds like probably quite good viewership in that I might I might look into that right after this the podcast so his Niche is horiculture and more specifically permaculture which I believe hopefully no one calls me out on this in the comments but I believe it's just like a a strain of horticulture that focuses more on like permanently like building out sustainable horiculture like you know resources uh plants Farms you know uh Water Systems this is what he focuses on on his channel that's like his background and if I was to tell you okay he's he nich is horiculture he's like a lecturer in horiculture um what do you think like his most huged recent video got well to answer that it's 12 million views wow got 12 million views on a video during our last cohort the video was how the UN is holding back the Sahara Desert and that has 12 million views in four months um and across his channel you're just seeing you know 1.5 million 1.6 million he's got multiple videos that are a million plus when he started his channel he was focusing much more on kind of a bit more Niche topics around like water harvesting uh rehydrating the concrete jungle like maybe show these videos on screen as we're talking about it a lot of these are much more kind of Niche and then he realized that wow even though this is like a small potentially boring Niche I can make really broad topics so that 12 million view video how the UN is holding back the Sahara Desert it's got a really interesting fil I love like the the left and right contrast in the fil the title itself how the UN so the UN is a very well-known thing you know the United Nations super wellknown everyone knows about it like really top of mind holding back the Sahara Desert like just that framing of holding back I love that that term holding back the Sahara Desert he is managed to build his niche of permaculture um and gardening basically into a topic that's relevant to 12 million plus people and I think that's like you know this is kind of what it's all about right when you when you think about how easy it would be for him to say oh I can never get views in this Niche because no one cares about permaculture or like you know there's not enough interesting topics I can't make the average person care about it well he made 12 million people care about a video about you know the Sahara Desert and permac culture in the Sahara Desert so it's a great example of just thinking beyond your Niche and kind of playing into some of the the key principles I think about when it comes to building out um big viewership in a smaller Niche and there are tools that can help you do that like today's sponsor one of 10 one of 10 is a tool specifically made to help YouTubers find better ideas using outlier videos here's how let's go over to the filters Tab and set the parameters for our search we'll set the multiplier to a 3X minimum meaning it will only show us videos that had three times the views relative to the average of that Channel's last five videos and we want these videos to have at least 100,000 views and were posted in the last year now we want to dig in and get really specific because we're thinking beyond our Niche here Let's Pretend We're uh a productivity Channel looking for our next big idea I'm going to search toys cuz why not we'll see where to go from here I tested illegal kids toys this is actually really interesting if you hover over that thumbnail you'll see that you can Dive Right into similar topics or thumbnails let's click topics oh look at this I tested 100 Years of kids toys what if we could do I tested 100 Years of productivity hacks or maybe I tested 100 Years of morning routines you know I could throw some history into the next video and make it really interesting knowing where to start and getting your creative juices flowing can feel like a really big task but with one of 10 it's really that easy to get your brainstorming process started you can try one of tent for one month for only $1 using the code Creator thank you to one of 10 for sponsoring this video if I'm thinking visually it kind of sounds like what you're suggesting is if you think about your Niche it's probably a subin interest of some number of cascading larger interests so it seems like the advice you're giving is to go upstream or a little bit more broad above that category to figure out what is the broadest or one of the broadest categories this sits with in and let's make videos that address that audience am I getting that correct absolutely absolutely like when I'm thinking about what are the um what are the traits of a viral video within an Niche the first thing on that list of traits that I look at is what I call CCN core casual new I'm looking for videos that hit our core so if we think about like our Niche like within our Niche there's like the really core viewers who like really care about the thing the second C stands for casual so core casual so are we hitting the more casual viewers that kind of dip in and dip out of this Niche and like care a little bit about it but they're maybe not as like hardcore viewers and are we hitting the new viewers so those are viewers that maybe aren't into the niche they haven't watched our channel before but there are people that just if they see something interesting they might click the video so just like how let's just say we talk about permaculture horiculture maybe I don't care about that maybe I'm not into it but if I see that video about how they un is holding back the Sahara Desert it's packaged in a way that can attract me as a new viewer it probably also attracts the core viewers who really care about that topic too and it attracts the casuals who kind of dip in and dip out the best way to look at your Niche and expand your Niche is look at every idea and say can a core casual and new viewer all click this video and enjoy it and I think that's where so many people go wrong they get too caught up in just the core they get too caught up in just like appeasing like the hardcore horiculture you know students and viewers who want to see these really technical things and they forget about the casual and the new viewer and then on the flip side some people get too caught up in the new viewer and they just forget to like also appeal to that core and they go too broad and they kind of miss miss the mark with the audience that they have been building so I really really like to think of that like that's that framework it sounds simple and I think I've mentioned it in tweets and things before but I cannot mention it enough because that just changes how you approach YouTube you look at every niche as like you said said a kind of expanding Niche and not like a limiting Niche so if I'm reading between the lines here a little bit it sounds like what you're saying is if I'm trying to grow my channel that means that I'm by definition trying to attract new viewers and the best way to attract new viewers is to make a video that has broader appeal so that it has a better chance of getting a click when it's in a recommended area to a stranger exactly exactly like broad broadening the peel of your niche is so crucial and I think there's this thing you know curse of knowledge bias where when we know something we assume everyone else knows it and what that means is sometimes as as you know creators in niches we can end up always trying to go like really specific and narrow to try to like show viewers new things but sometimes we just forget that like oh actually the more simple things the more simple ways of framing things like that might seem obvious to us but maybe that expands the reach of the video maybe it makes it more interesting to you know broader group of people so yeah I'm always looking at it and saying like how can we just make sure that we're not just limiting it to the horee viewers and often if you're if you're hardcore enough of a niche of a fan of a niche to make a YouTube channel around it you're going to want to go really Niche and specific but that's in itself a trap because then you end up just appealing to other people that are just as hardcore about the niche as you are and that's probably a very small percentage of viewers is there a risk here of making something that is so broadly appealing that it goes well and suddenly our audience isn't targeted for what we're actually trying to do anymore yeah I think I think I always find that point kind of interesting because there definitely is something to it but from my point of view like I would describe myself as like a view maximizer you know and I am very like open about that like I go into channels and I try to maximize views I try to take channels from a million views a month to 10 million views a month to 100 million views a month there are so many other objectives we have as creators sometimes that objective might be hey we actually have a niche product that is actually more focused on the more hardcore you know really focused viewers in this Niche so expanding out broad doesn't actually do much for our bigger business um and in that case it's okay to just like Focus down on that more specific viewer but if our goal is to grow viewership then I don't think we should ever be afraid of trying to expand that out so long as we're not just like you know doing absolutely random stuff just in you know in attempt just jumping on any Trend so long as there's still that core casual and new which is why you have to hit each one of those points because if you're just going after the new VI if you're just like randomly jumping onto any Trend you can then you're not bringing along your core with you um but yeah it's it's kind of fascinating how many creators come to me and they say like I want to get more views I'm like okay here's more views and they're like oh now that I've got more views I don't like how it means I have to make these more broad videos and it's like it's the classic Trope it's like the classic case of like the the alt band saying they want to make it rich and famous they make it rich and famous and now they're like oh I miss when I was like able to play these small shows and like had this real connection now we have people in the audience who are just wearing t-shirts and don't actually know the music and you know it's the classic kind of like situation but I think it's really it really comes down to the Creator to be really clear to themselves but then also if they if they end up working with someone like me or someone else to be like my my main objective is product sales for this Niche product and in which case I'll be like okay let's instead of focusing on getting you to 10 million views a month let's focus on getting you to two or three million really targeted views per month um and that would actually end up contributing more to the overall business yeah that that leads me to what may sound like a really obvious or weird question but who should be a views maximizer like what is the conditions where views maximization is the right thing to be chasing what what else needs to be true for me I think like the first thing is if if you're main vehicle for generating revenue and we could also get even like very meta on this and say like is even generating Revenue your goal because if a Creator is just like I want to make enough to pay my bills and just really make content I'm passionate about that sometimes can be at odds with generating more Revenue through views you know so like we have to be kind of clear about what we want to do but if you're if your main vehicle for for Revenue generation is AD revenue and I mean that in terms of AdSense on you videos and sponsorships on YouTube videos if that's your main vehicle that you see as the main way to make revenue on your channel you should be a view maximizer in my opinion within reason you know because there's even like you know more deeper arguments around hey like if you go too broad your viewers might not convert as well to um sponsorships and etc etc so like there's there's always these kind of exceptions and things to think about and you know there's a friend of mine who runs a YouTube agency and his name is Dave wiscus if you ever heard of him and he always like talks about how yeah like sometimes these like creators have really viral view counts and they do really well but from a sponsorship perspective the data shows they don't actually convert because they go so broad so like there is like all these kind of exceptions things to think about things to take into consideration but most channels could benefit from having a mindset of I want to get more views and I want to like build out a bigger audience especially people that are like still maybe below that line of being able to make a full-time living from it so I I would say the only people I would discount are people that are looking at it and saying hey I can make more money by focusing on a very small specific group of viewers and those people might be people who sell like a product a course like if you're selling like a course let's say you're selling a course on how to like you know effectively use slack you know as a as a manager you want to Target managers that use slack in the organization you don't want to make a video like you know I use slack for 3,000 hours I used every product tool for like stuff like that might not really bring in the right kind of viewership for you so I think getting really clear about where your main vehicle for generating revenue is but I would say most people their main vehicle is still ad sales um through AdSense or through sponsorship and through maybe Affiliates and other things as opposed to a product even for people with the product though there's still more of that viewership that you can attract you just have to be a bit more tactful you don't you don't want to just completely go and say hey I'm just going to try and make the most Mr beastify viral video I can it's more about within my Niche what can I do so I'm just even thinking of an example like let's just say you're you are this slack example we gave you sell a course on how to use slack as a manager so making like a really weird viral video where you're like trying to like go viral with slack in some way probably isn't a great idea but making a video that follows a trend that has gone super viral across multiple niches which is if I was to start over with Slack here's what i' do we've seen that go viral like if I had to start coding all over again here's what i' do if I started to learn web design over again here's what I do you'll see these examples of plenty of outliers so as that channel you could look at that and model off that video and say hey could I do that for slack maybe it won't get 500,000 views but if I'm used to getting a th000 views a video and that gets 30,000 views we have maximized views you know we've increased views and we brought in the right kind of viewership so I think for channels that just have a specific vehicle they sell to through a specific Revenue generating vehicle like a product or like something more Niche you have to still think about it as core casual new but in this case your new viewer is not going to be just a complete casual your new viewers maybe just like still someone that uses slack but just isn't like your exact customer profile I'm curious to hear what are some of the aspects or similarities across videos and different niches that you see lead to virality what are the what are the commonalities of videos across niches that all go viral so I'd really like to make it very simple number one the video has to have CCN fit so we've already talked about that core casual new fit we won't dive into that again but the first thing should be does this idea have interest across all those bases I I've referenced this before in the past but like even for my channel when I was active on my own Channel with my own name like I would look at it and say the world's biggest Creator needs to be able to watch this and and my mother needs to be able to watch this you know someone who is like an absolute hardcore YouTube Nerd and then also someone that's just roughly interested in the whole platform so core casual new a second trait of viral videos that I look for for any nich is some form of unique novelty value something about it that makes this video just feel like it's its own thing its own Island and not just like another you know screaming into the void idea something unique so we talked about that Andrew millison um example of you know the UN holding back the Sahara Desert like that feels like he has some information something new that I don't know that I haven't heard before so always looking for that like what is unique what is novel about what I can talk about and that kind of goes into why we should spend so much time on brainstorming and trying to find new fresh things for our Niche so that's another thing sounds simple but number three easy to convey entitle and thumbnail so many great ideas are hard to convey entitle thumbnail and they're just not great ideas then they're just you know they're just interesting things they're not great ideas CU a great idea has to be easy to convey in a title th mail um and I get really annoyed at YouTubers saying I've got this amazing idea I just kind of think give had to thumbnail it and I'm like you don't have an amazing idea then so that would be the third thing like making sure you convey in the title F out really easily and then the fourth thing that I always look for is like other people in your Niche or even friends that like have similar interest to you when you mention the idea to them do they get excited like do they just genuinely feel like oh that's interesting that's exciting and I I always like this idea of building a bit of a council around yourselves like a YouTube Council around yourselves so that you can ask people like hey I'm thinking you're doing this like do you find that interesting do you find that you know does that make you excited so when I'm when I'm looking at these niches like if you just start applying these little Frameworks to like how you think about it even the first one just being CCN fit you're naturally going to start looking at bigger videos you're not going to just look at like a really specific thing let's just take another Niche for example so um it's just they give another channnel 731 Woodworks it's a woodworking Channel now I think woodworking is really interesting but you could argue that like it's not a niche that you can Mr beastify it's not a niche you can like make viral because it's just all about like tools and whatever if you look at that channel um a lot of the videos are built around viral formats they are things like testing hacks testing woodworking hacks or 99% of Woodworkers get this thing wrong or you know this tool is now illegal in seven and a half States or you know there there's just like these these funny ideas that are built around just like looking at the idea and saying okay my core is like hardcore Woodworkers but how do we also make these topics interesting to people that like do it as more of a hobby or maybe they're just generally interested in making things but they're not like a hardcore woodworker so instead of being like reviewing the uh you know wood Tron woodsa 3,400 um Second Edition it's just like this tool is so good it should be illegal or um reviewing the uh the most expensive woodworking tool in the world or comparing the wish you know saw to like this $500 saw you know like he's looking at it and saying how can I make things Broad and viral so um yeah I think it is really just about looking bigger and just thinking of unique novel Broad and some of these other traits we've mentioned for these viral videos across niches what about their packaging gets people to click how do you think about title and thumbnail so that people want to actually click I would always say like too too many people get caught up in the like the design itself like the Aesthetics so often I just look at it and say it's showing something simple so you can look at it um I'm not even sure maybe we talked about this on the last podcast but I always like this idea of the glance test sometimes I'll put my thumb on a Google slide and the slide before I'll have just a blank white Slide the slide after I'll have a blank white slide and I'll just flick onto the thumbnail slide really quickly and I'll keep the thumbnail quite small as well and I'll just ask myself can I process what's on screen like in that Split Second because people just vastly overestimate how much time the average viewer looks at a thumbnail the average viewer looks at a thumbnail for well under a second like it's going to be milliseconds it's very hard to like study this but the sort of nonperfect scientific stud I've done on this like just from observing people scrolling and just some other tests I've tried like people look at thumbnails for milliseconds so you need to have something in there that's just really easy to process and get across right away so you know this idea I came up with this idea um I don't want to say came up with it because it makes it sound like I take the credit but a few years ago in a video I I mentioned this idea called the three element rule the reason I I I brought that up and the reason why I think a lot of people use it and reference it is because you shouldn't really have more more than three things that the viewer is focusing on in a thumbnail if anything three is even too much like can you just have like one to three little things they have to focus on so if I'm having to look at a face another face an item text over here a logo over here text over down here there's too much in a thumbnail and too many beginners just feel I have all this space let's fill it but if you then go and look at the most viral videos on YouTube so many of them like they have empty space like you know instead of like showing like this saw with like all these things point at it these different arrows is text over here text over there sometimes it's just as simple as just like an arrow a saw and a face or something you know instead of having too much stuff filling up the screen so I think Simplicity is is really important and then just like trying to show something this is always hard to kind of convey in words but trying to show something that looks a little bit it's like on the verge of believable um or unbelievable it's like it's not misleading but it's exaggeration of the thing so like can we show something that you know if we're trying to show the world's uh most expensive saw in a video I don't think it's clickbait to go in and like add some gold onto the saw or like put some shine on it like put like a little like diamond encrusted thing on it or something so we're going in and just enhancing some of the details to just make it feel still it's still not clickbait because we're still showing the world's most expensive saw and the world's most expensive saw probably looks pretty good but we're going in and we're just trying to like make it look a bit more shiny and clickable so I think if you combine Simplicity and exaggeration without going too far in the realm of clickbait you have a really nice formula for for good thumbnails and and also a lot of it is just like you know studying other thumbnails in your Niche like what are the what are people clicking on because like someone would bring up like oh at this Niche people only click on this kind of stuff or like I've even seen in different geographies like for example in um quite a lot of like countries like Singapore or like Malaysia countries um that speak a different language especially Asian countries they actually quite often click on thumbnails with a lot more text in them than in the Western World I've just noticed that um so you know that's always something to think about as well like culture Niche what's working your Niche but generally speaking I don't think you can go wrong by saying let's keep it simple and let's exaggerate something slightly you talk so much about all of the pre-production work with packaging and thinking about an idea how much of a difference does that pre-production really make love that question because I would say the biggest difference I think between top level creators and beginner creators is top level creators we're putting way more time into the pre-production into planning before we make the content whereas a lot of more beginners will just sort of say I want to make this here's roughly how I think about it let's make it you know so putting like real thought into developing these things before we even press record before we even end up writing the script like I want to see like actual details of how this could go because at some level on YouTube it just becomes a game of decision- making and our decisions are like what do we pursue just like how in a really big business like someone like an Amazon they have all these potential they can make money in so many areas they can do it here here here and everywhere but they have to sit in their boardroom and say like out of these 100 opportunities like which are the ones that we should focus our energy on some as a point of frustration for me is when I talk to people who are either beginner YouTubers or a bit more inexperienced or even like people completely outside YouTube Niche like you know the brands that my company works with and different people they will look at it and they will kind of be a little bit put out or a little bit sometimes honestly frustrated with me with how much detail I put on these little little things like you know how much I will push for a certain tile over another title an example I actually bring up quite a lot is um we work at Red Bull that's one of our bigger clients we had this video um a few months ago which was world's fastest camera drone versus F1 car that video I believe has 20 million plus views so that title I think is a great title it's just really simple straight to the point you get it but if we had titled it something else and there were other titles on the drawing board that we could have used if we had titled it something that was maybe 10 or 20% worse the video wouldn't have 10 or 20% less views it might have a fraction of the views it it might have like two or three million views which is still Lots obviously but YouTubers often think of it too linearly and think okay 20% better title yeah the video might get 20% more views but what if I prefer this title or what if I don't like calling it this other title like it's not going to make that much difference can I just call it this title but a 20% better title could mean double triple quadruple it could mean a 100 times more views because YouTube is this exponential game and returns are nonlinear like a 20% better thing might mean the video ends up doing a bit better with more people and then that can lead this snowball in motion which can then lead to more and more and more views so being a bit better with a lot of people can lead to a much bigger return than you can imagine so the reason I push like focusing on title fil focusing on the topic focusing how you present things and this pre-production so hard is because these things make a massive difference and honestly like I can't say how many times in my career I've had I've been in rooms with people where they've been like we like your title Patty but we think we want to go with this title and then I say why and they go like it just feels a bit more aligned to our brand and then I would say okay like aligning to your brand is really important but if I was to say your title will get 1 million views and my one will get 10 million views would you feel the same way and they'd say how can you know that I'm like I don't know that but I do know that Myan is 10 or 20% better and being 10 or 20% better in an infinite exponential game has huge outside returns you know the video won't just get 1.2 million views versus 1 million maybe it will get 1 million versus 10 million so it's one of the reasons I get so excited about these little nerdy small details um and yeah even that example we use from Andrew mson of the the UN Sahara video like that video with like a different title or a slightly different thumbnail that topic might have only got 500,000 views instead of 12 million how do I take that Insight which I agree with and believe and not allow it to paralyze me from publishing at all setting a limit on how long you you give yourself to to overthink I I think some overthinking is fine but just set a limit if you're overthinking a title for week big problem if you're overthinking it for an hour and then after that hour you say I have to come up with something and and stick with it you know just just make that happen so I think setting a time limit and then also like realizing and understanding that there will be always views left on the table like there's not a single video I've worked on in my entire career that we got 100% of the views we could have got every single video I've ever worked on we could have got even more views with something slightly different but it's just a game of getting us close to Perfection as possible but Perfection needs to have a time limit you need some constraint otherwise you'll just not post anything so I think especially for smaller creators like the reason I even bring up this point of like nonlinear returns and how exponential YouTube is is to excite us with the potential we have but when you're a small Creator like it's still so important to just like publish publish videos right because the pursuit of perfection the pursuit of perfection doesn't account for the other factor in that equation which is timeline and the the longer time goes on on the less learning we have the less videos we're publishing the less we're like you know trying to to to make things happen don't know if this analogy will hit but like imagine like you were someone that just always tried to find like the perfect husband or wife forever but then by the time you finally find them you're like 65 and it's like oh you know like in my pursuit of perfection I forgot that the other timeline was was actual time passing so I think that's a a way of thinking about it is we can be perfectionist we can overthink but just for an hour just for two hours not for two weeks it's empowering because it it goes to s a little bit of extra work on the package on the title and thumbnail and the idea can have outsized returns so that's where there's leverage that's where you should put a little bit of extra time because finding a little bit of a breakthrough can have a huge return for you but you're right there has to be a limit otherwise we'll we'll go back and forth forever absolutely the majority of people watching this probably are still feeling like ah my Channel's pretty small I haven't really broken through yet and so I'm wondering if there's like an order of operations when the Channel's small and I'm getting started for which of the core casual and new I should develop first like should I go broad first to try and get in front of a lot of people so that some of those people become core fans or should I start a little bit more narrow develop the core fandom and then broaden out from there what do you do you think about that there's actually it that question really ties in well with a tweet I made yesterday which was how I would grow a YouTube channel from scratch in 12 months 12 steps and I broke the 12 steps into these different phases phase one I called establishment phase two I called improvements and phase three I called optimization so I almost like thinking of like a YouTube's Channel's like growth along those lines first of all you just need to establish yourself like what am I what am I doing I need to start making videos I need to get good at making videos then you need to get into this phase of like now I need to keep improving upon that establishment like improve in all these different areas start thinking about strategy and start thinking about idea generation more deeply and then over time you end up optimizing and tweaking to get to that Final Destination you want to be so for your question I think we're looking more at that like establishment stage so like before we really think about like how do we you know get in depth on all this stuff look at all this data retention curves like we need to figure out like what we are and who we are as a channel and will say throughout my entire career it's always worked better for me to focus more narrow and more at that core first and then expand out over time uh because you just it's you can never go the other way you can't really start like going after the broad and then go more narrow because that's just like what alienate so many of those viewers I think it's it's e also easier to get traction when you're focusing on a bit more of a specific smaller Niche um I'm even thinking back to like when I used to have um music channels like I would start with like a really specific sub genre of a niche of music then I would start building out so if it starts with like French deep uh deep hip-hop or deep bass or something drum and bass then it would like expand a little bit out to like European drama base then even further you know it would just kind of build from a really small core and then grow from there because you can kind of almost look at it like almost like monkey bars to like different places like you you start in here and then because you're here that means that some of this niches overlap okay so now I can sort of expand out to this broader thing with some overlap with my thing and then I can expand out over here and before you know it you can kind of capture more of the total total Niche or total whole niche as itself because like every Niche has like sub niches like we've kind of alluded to but yeah I find it I find it really interesting how like sometimes I I look at a new Creator and immediately they're trying to make these super viral like really broad videos there are examples of where that works um I have a friend James Janny who I reference quite a bit cuz I think he's just such a really great Creator his first few videos got like millions of views like he just he just hit it out the park right away that is the exception survivorship bias is such a real thing with with YouTube if you look at most channels that are now doing 100K 200k 500k a million views a video they started more Niche down so start Niche and expand and grow from there for sure how do I know when I'm moving out of the established phase and into the growth phase where I need to be looking more at data and analytics and things I think some of it is like volume of videos posted so people will argue with with me on this like I'm sure like other strategists might disagree with this but like The more I've realized this like I've been doing this for 10 years now creators just get overwhelmed if you say to a Creator hey you need to start making videos you need to start making two videos a week and you need to learn all about retention curves you need to learn data you need to learn how to like come up with good ideas you need to learn how to package you need to learn all this stuff it can just be like really overwhelming so how do you go from like that establishment phase to that Improvement sort of growth phase I think what you do first is say am I in a consistent you know Cadence of posting videos some people will say Patty you've said in the past that you know a consistent schedule doesn't matter it doesn't matter algorithmically but it can matter a lot mentally and philosophically for yourself to get into like a regular Cadence of posting if you're really good you can post whenever you want but you're not really good at the start so you need to kind of have that repetition over time so the first thing I would look at before moving into that stage is are we posting regularly and have we learned how to make videos you know like this sounds silly but like every YouTuber that we look up to they know how to like roughly make things you know um and there's some examples I think especially in this like new age of create creation where like people can hire editors and th designers earlier in the process but still like even if if I look at myself like I can edit videos I can I could edit a video if you sat down there and sent me the clips for this and put it together I could edit it is it going to be very good no but it'll be passible I can make thumbnails I made thumbnails for years I've made thumbnails for clients like I can go into to photoshop and make thumbnails I have the fundamental skills to be a Creator so I love the idea that in that establishment phase instead of working and thinking about strategy too deeply we're building those fundamental skills we're making videos ideally maybe one or two videos every single week and we're doing that for a period of time where maybe we have 30 40 50 videos posted then we look at it and say okay let's say we got 50 videos posted we have learned the skills in Photoshop and video editing now we have a foundation where we can put strategy on top it's kind of it's kind of frustrating when I see someone put really a lot of effort into strategy and ideation and coming up with like really good ideas but their execution is so weak that they're just wasting those ideas so like at the start I just say make whatever you want like pick your Niche like we need to pick our Niche we need to pick our Niche SL subnation like focusing on that but then from there just make what calls to you make what interests you like make what feel like passionate about some of it will maybe do okay some of it will do terrible the majority probably won't do anything at all um and then over time you can then look at it and say I'm sitting in this position where I've been doing this for four or five months now I have 50 videos posted I've got the fundamental skills if I now put the strategy component on top if I now think about my YouTube studio if I start studying my retention curves if I start putting more effort into brainstorming ideas so instead of just saying I'm going to make whatever I want to we're going to start thinking about it and saying I'm going to put a huge amount of effort into brainstorming I'm going to schedule time each week to brainstorm ideas I'm going to use a process of elimination to make sure I pick the best ideas we start putting more strategy behind it we have a foundation we can build upon so I think before moving into that stage we just need to make sure we're making videos consistently and we're improving and we've got a foundation of skill for you know Photoshop video editing whatever it might be and if that Foundation of skill isn't one you have yourself it's at least having someone on your team that you've built to cover those areas I think that's so true I talked to a lot of creators who are stuck around platform strategy they haven't even decided yet which platforms should I be posting on and they'll ask me like should I do YouTube and YouTube has the most moving parts of any platform in my opinion the most variables that could go wrong and sync the performance of the entire video if you don't do it pretty well you really have to get a lot of things working in concert from the idea to the packaging which is both title and thumbnail uh not just the composition of it but the literal visual design of it then you need to make sure the video starts out really well so you have good retention uh you probably need to keep people's attention throughout the whole video obviously there's just so many each of these things are like their own art form almost and you can get good at all of it and that's what the great YouTubers are doing but it's such an investment of time that in the beginning you need to get reps of doing the whole video so you at least experience and start building the muscle memory of all of these different moving parts and variables involved I couldn't agree more couldn't agree more like sometimes I I actually have been quite reflect of like the advice I've given over the years and like how I've approached things and sometimes I have like this benefit of I've done it for 10 15 years I have this experience these repetitions and we talked a bit earlier about this curse of knowledge bias sometimes I forget like how many little skills go into making a channel happen so to think about like a new viewer being told hey you need to learn how to edit that's hard you need to learn how to do thumbnails that's also hard you need to learn how to like storytelling camera you need to learn how to like you know do some basic lighting color grading do all that stuff and you need to do this every week and you need to come up with ideas and then be like also as well you need to think really deeply about strategy you need to follow what Patty gway says on Twitter where he says he goes through this whole process of like hundreds of ideas and you can just imagine how overwhelming that is so I love the idea of just breaking it down into those different stages and I think that's the best way to grow like a channel from scratch or from smaller to a big Channel or at least a channel doing quite well momentum wise as as fast as possible um and yeah I think like it's kind of when I really break it down like YouTube is unlike any other platform in that it is really really really difficult to get good at but when you get good at it it starts to feel quite easy it starts to feel like you know you can be in this position where earlier in this podcast I said I feel I have the confidence to feel that I can make any nich faral and I haven't had negative reinforcement to tell me I can't you know every time I've done something with someone with enough time we have made progress and we have got viewership and it's quite an easy input output game when you learn what the inputs are but yeah it's Cra Crazy overwhelming to think about starting on YouTube today and having all this information all these people talking saying you need to do this this and this sometimes you just need to take a bit of time to be quiet and make 30 40 50 videos and just learn how to edit and make thumbil on storytale if you do that first few months you're going to have a much better Foundation if I'm looking at other videos that have been successful maybe it's my own videos maybe it's other videos in my Niche maybe it's videos outside of my Niche but I can see that this video had the outcome that I want it had the type of views that I'm looking to get how do I start to understand what made that video successful yeah I think there's a few things I like to do the first thing is just like actually having these prompts so like writing these prompts down maybe you can just actually take a screenshot of the video and put it in a Google doc or a notion or whatever you use for your note taking and just have these prompts instead to just like reflect on them so one prompt I was like is what made this unique so we talked about earlier about how you know viral videos usually have some level of unique novelty value so like what did make this unique like was it something in the topic was it like something specific to this thumbil that made it different to everything else so what made this unique I was like to ask myself like what about the packaging made it special what about the packaging made it an outlier like was there some way they titled it or thumbnailed it that just felt different to how most people in the space do it or just built up upon a bit of a different format than most people something that I think is um super interesting is when I do see these outlier videos like these and when I say outlier I'm thinking like a video that gets three or four times more than the average at minimum on a channel usually when I see an outlier it's not going to be oh they tried a different color grade or oh they upgraded their camera those things matter but they don't have this kind of like exponential difference usually what it's more often about is hey something about the idea itself the title or the thumbnail is what made that such an outlier so I really like to dig into those things and ask myself those questions of made it unique what about the title film now another really good prompt is why did this go viral and others similar to it didn't so there is a lot of survivorship bias at stake here where sometimes people can look at like a video and say oh this went really viral but then if you look deeper you'll see they tried the same video like eight other times that didn't go viral so you have to ask yourself like was this just a lucky break on this video or was there something different or unique about it so I think you can learn a lot by saying hey this person wasn't the first to cover this topic but the other people that covered this topic got 10,000 views and this guy got 150,000 views why like what was let's put them side by side let's look at some differences and how it's actually put together that can make a big difference a lot of it you can never be 100% sure but a lot of it is if you just start reflecting more and digging deeper into that video and just looking at things like the timing as well when it came out how the views trended over time I think that's a really useful way to do it and also I'll give a quick shout out to um to my friend Chucky who's just launched stats um alongside Mr Beast like they have some interesting tools which allows you to like search reverse basically like reverse search a thumbnail so if you have a thumbnail that you see that goes really viral you can place it into their their thumbnail search and it will like look at like other thumbnails um like it so you can see oh were they the first person to come up with this concept or maybe they saw this concept go super viral in another Niche and they tried it in this Niche and that's why it went viral so I think the more like deeper thing here is just taking time to really reflect on a video as oppos to to just being like chalking it down to something really quickly oh it's because they have more money than me or oh it's because they're a bigger Channel or oh it's because XY Z if you actually just sit there and just try to reflect and almost like Journal around why a certain video did well you can learn a lot if I'm looking at my own channel and one of my videos that performed better than I anticipated is there any data in YouTube Studio that you look at that you feel like is a reliable indicator or gives you some sort of unique insight into why a video did better than you might have expected expected honestly there's nothing there's nothing really that just like gives you a definitive answer like here are some things I would look at if a video went way better than expected I would look at the demographics so like is it appealing to a bit of a different audience than usual sometimes I've seen this where like a video goes really viral I'm like digging into why that could be and then I realize oh it's going really viral in a certain country it might be getting a lot of viewership in India and then I try to figure out why is it getting a lot of viewership in India or you know maybe it's going really viral with a different age group to what I'm used to and it's resonating really well there so dig a bit into the demographics and try to figure out if there's any Trends there I look I like to look at device type so going to YouTube Studio clicking Advance mode and looking at device type and seeing are we getting more views on a different device type to usual could that be a reason behind you know the the extra viewership are we like doing really well on this video on TV why could that be well maybe because this video was longer than our average videos and longer videos typically do better on TV or you know start to like build some hypothesis from that I also like to look at the new viewer metric to see like what you know what number of views on this video were new viewers versus returning viewers just to give us an idea of like oh maybe it's just because this video ended up resonating really well with new viewers and then you can bring it back to yourself to ask yourself the question of why why was that the case and obviously just like studying the view Trend over time as well did this get like a lot of views really quickly or did it slowly build did it rank in search traffic sources like where was that traffic coming from so I'm sort of throwing out these different things I'll look at but it all comes back to the fact that you're not going to have like a single thing that says here's exactly why this went viral so much of it is just looking at all the data points looking at all you know about the video and how it performed and taking that time to adequately reflect on it so many creators they just like see something goes viral and they just like spend like three seconds or you know thinking oh that went viral because of this let's just do more of that you know instead of like taking a bit of time to dig into it so um there's no data point there's no magic data point that gives you the reason the video went viral but you can look at these things to sort of paint the picture I always like that metaphor of like data kind of like can start to color in some of the picture but you still need to zoom out and look at the full picture and see oh here's why this video went viral we get a lot of people who ask me hey why did your video with Jenny Hoyos do so well and it's like a hilarious question because if I knew the answer to that I would just do that every time uh but you know it's it's about to cross 3 million views and the one thing that I can point to and say this was definitively different about this video is it had a higher click-through rate in the first 24 hours and so now I just spin myself out saying how do I get the best click-through rate in the first 24 hours uh but it's so hard to know what combination of title and thumbnail amongst the the stable of titles and thumbnails we've thought about which one will be the best one how do you how do you test packaging to try to find the best answer before you actually push it live on a video yeah so I want to dig into this because this is really interesting because CTR itself is a very fickle and in some ways infuriating metric where if you ask me is CTR useful I would say CTR as a metric obviously like the act of people clicking on a video is extremely important so when people say C is useless or not useful then people take the wrong takeaway of saying oh thumbnails don't matter it's just not how you think about it but CTR as an entire metric is very difficult because the more Impressions the video gets the lower the CTR drops typically so you'll probably see even on that Jenny hoya video over time that CTR is probably dropped quite a bit lower but CTR itself as a whole is not very useful but C in the first hour first 24 hours can be a good predictor of success on videos like I've seen that for lots of our clients so when people say CTR is not useful at all I'd point to the fact that there's a very strong correlation between first hour CTR and long-term video performance on a lot of established channels um not all channels but quite often so I would look at it and say even with that video like you know tile thumb Mount now everyone on YouTube or pretty much everyone over the next few weeks is going to have ABC testing so that's like going to be such a big unlock because you can make up a couple different options and like test your theories in action of like which one gets more clicks I would actually with that video Let's just just think about that video for a minute like I would dig a bit deeper though like is it something you did with the design or is it something more to do with like the topic I think it's it's kind of interesting when you see Jenny and and Jenny is like quite young right she's like 18 17 18 um and she just seeing that I think by Nature that just makes it look a bit unique because it's like this very young girl who has figured out like something really really difficult and she's doing so well it's kind of like how there's videos where you see you know this like bring it to the other side but like sometimes I've seen these videos with it's just like an old guy giving advice it's like old gives advice you could probably show that thumb on screen old man gives advice and people ask why did that video go so well I'm like well because you don't usually scroll through your YouTube feed and see this old guy you know giving advice and I think on the same level like this space like this space of content creation and like um you know you know coming up with strategy and YouTube and how to grow I would say it's very I'd say it's generally quite male dominated uh which I think is a shame cuz I I love when I see like uh more female people coming in and talking about this niche as well but it's quite male dominated and it's also quite a lot of like you know guys a bit older um you know guys my age and above um don't want to sound like a boomer or anything but you know I think some people like a little bit older so you see this like younger girl talking about something it just makes it unique right and then also I love how you you titled it and I love how you like put that thumb out text of like you know I can make anything viral I think those are the things I would look at so maybe it's more about the guest and more about you know the perception of that guest and like how you see that how that makes it unique as opposed to like something specific you did in that packaging so if I was you I would start brainstorming like huh is there like any other like really young um upand cominging creators who have like figured it out at a young age so for example I know there's like these kids I've seen do podcasts that are like 16 17 and they're making like 300K a month with like YouTube or SnapChat or something and it's like when you see that you're like part of you feels terrible cuz you're like well when I was 16 you know was making like $3 a month um so like how did that how does that happen but I think there's something unique about that itself so a great example like digging deeper and like some people could look at that and just say oh this went viral because oh we placed the text a little bit to the right or we had this thing in the bottom corner which we don't usually have but it's much more likely around the actual topic the subject material which is I guess the Creator you're interviewing um and how you package that to the viewer than like little details like that let's look at how you vet ideas when I have an idea and I'm thinking okay I want this to hit my core casual new I feel pretty good about that what are the next steps from there for how I prioritize certain video ideas that I have making sure like I always think about this idea of the idea funnel so you have this big funnel that you put ideas into and the end result is your funnel spits out different ideas that you can then like prioritize based on what you're feeling most excited about so like how do we put things into the funnel I was like to say there's three main sources of ideas internal ideas so things that have worked for us in the past so looking internally like what has worked on our channel can we come up with more ideas like that external ideas things that have worked for our competitors or even just other channels across YouTube how can we come up with ideas based on things that have worked for them and then Innovation so just sort of more blue ocean like looking you know across YouTube across different Industries and saying like what's something Innovative and new that I can come up with so if you're contributing lots of ideas into the funnel from those different sources you then pass through to the kind of the filter part part which is your main question here is like how do we actually eliminate them down and I think you know asking yourselves does it have that core casual new VI of fit it's a great question um asking Is it feasible to make happen so like if you went and did brainstorming this is kind of funny when I work with like new strategists because you know I have to I hire strategists from my business and I also like interview and talk to a lot of like upand cominging people and first of all I'll say like people are really good like some of these young kids are such good strategist and I think about YouTube really deeply but the one thing they sometimes don't understand is like limitations and feasibility so they'll be like let's uh let's you know let's say we're brainstorming ideas for like a wildlife Channel and we could say let's come up with an idea which is like I I swam covered in blood uh with like 10 great white sharks it's like yeah that would go viral but it also might kill the Creator so like you know we got to be careful so like thinking about the feasibility of ideas is is is super important so is this feasible can we make it happen another one I get is like people come up with these ideas but it's like you know if you brainstormed for your podcast and said like um how do we get to a million views well if you had Mr Beast on for an episode probably get to a million views but that's also quite difficult because you need to you know get a contact with Jimmy you need to like convince him that it's a good idea you probably need to grow this podcast more before he'd want to do it so like there's all these like things that get in the way so like having that feasibility and using that as a as a score as well is important so like does it f CCN It Is it feasible the title thumbnail as well like can we actually come up with title thumbil like not only can we say yeah we can come up with it can we actually come up with one before we even go further with this like can we come up with the tile we call it and like a rough sketch of the thumbnail that can like eliminate so if you have 100 ideas in the funnel maybe the CCN fit you eliminate like 40 of them because so many videos don't have that feasibility you eliminate like 20 of them so you've got like 40 left right then you say can I come up with title thumbil for them before you know it out of those 40 you have left now you're looking at and saying well only half of I can actually think of what I would title fum Al them so you got 20 left and then some other questions you could ask like am I actually genuinely as a Creator excited and want to make this video because some people are surprised when I say that because I am like I mentioned earlier like a views maximizer someone that just wants to get more views but if if I think about if our goal is to get more views it's not going to really work really well if I keep making the Creditor make these ideas they don't like doing because at some point they're just going to want to not do that anymore they're going to get burnt out so long term that's going to hurt us so it's still important that the Creator like feels passionate and excited about them so even for you yourself as a Creator just looking at it and saying am I excited to interview this person am I excited to do this thing like does this like make me want to make the content maybe then you've got 20 ideas left and that limites it down to 10 then when it comes to the 10 I always like to do this thing which I call the onepage idea development so on a one pager I like to have just a rough thumbnail sketch I like to have a rough title so you have a thumb sketch rough title I like to have a y um Square the Y Square I just like like to list one or two or three points of like why this video is going to work and then I like to just roughly list out like the log line of the videos like roughly what the video is going to be about so if I have 10 ideas left I'm developing each one of those 10 ideas and those those one Pages again I can already hear people saying that's so much work I've done I can do 10 onepage ideas in like an hour or two you know especially when you think about the ideas being such a source for views and momentum across a whole Channel like we can spare an hour or two to develop out these ideas you know they deserve that at least so I've developed them out in this one page I have 10 ideas then I just like to look at it myself I like to ask you know if I've got employees or if I have like other people that are in my Niche or just friends I just like to then present those ideas so instead of getting on a call and saying hey I'm thinking about doing this idea where we swim with a great white shark it's like here's the idea here's the log line what do you think here's the idea here's the log line what do you think and just going through and asking different people's opinion like even you know myself I think I have like a good measure of what a great video is for the different clients we work with but without that like ability to just ask others opinion you're just going to be isolated and you're going to you know Focus too much on your ego and like what you think is right so even I really like to ask just random people like even just like sometimes they get surprised but like maybe there's like a random new editor on a team and I'll be like what's you think of this idea and they're like I don't know I'm just I just started here I'm like no what do you think like do can you could you imagine this one being interesting so asking lots of opinions and then you're left with three or four videos that you want to prioritize and you develop them from there what do you think people are dead wrong about with the current state of YouTube either they have the wrong belief or they completely miss something that is happening that they should be paying attention to I would say the biggest sort of hot take I have on YouTube which shouldn't be a hot take but it is based on how most people think about it is there is no meta there's no like one way one meta to do YouTube and I feel that often times a lot of people try to like declare the New Direction content is going in like all content is moving towards storytelling or all content is moving towards longer videos or you know we've got this guy Sam suluk if you've seen him like people are like look at Sam it shows that thumbnails is dead I even saw this tweet recently where someone was like the thumbnail bubble is about to burst because like you could see like some of these thumbnails on like samsul and like other channels are like focusing on doing less Les editing less th that design but all these things kind of fail to realize how big YouTube is 5 10 years ago there was people that focused on storytelling and made really long videos that were doing well in 5 to 10 years from now there'll be people that make two or three minute videos and don't focus on storytelling that be doing well there's just so much YouTube is so expansive that there's no one way to make content there's no one meta and yet people always just try to say oh it's Mr beastify but even during the peak of what what you could call Mr beastify on YouTube where everyone was complaining about Mr Beast is ruin YouTube if you actually studied the trending videos and the most of our our videos on YouTube about five to 10% you could classify as Mr Beast ofi videos you know so even in this like bubble of everything being this big spectical it still only accounted for like five or 10% of the trending videos and that's only that's what the trending videos if you look across YouTube it's probably still only one or two% of all YouTube viewership is focused on that kind of content so that's not downplaying the impact of Trends that's not downplaying the fact that yes we are moving into a a world right now where YouTube videos are getting a bit longer and people are putting in more storytelling and leaving out you know leaving the sort of really fast retention editing um out a bit more but that's still just a trend it's not the meta you know so like there's no one way to do YouTube there's no one meta things are are super super varied to continue learning from Patty check out our first conversation where we talk even more about his process for coming up with good ideas and thumbnails it's quite lit literally the interview that changed this channel so make sure you grab your notebook [Music]

====== Estudo_Especialista_112_Reacting To YouTubers Thumbnail Mistakes ====== 
I asked members of my mailing list to send me their channels to review and on the form I asked them to write down what they struggled with the most on YouTube and nearly every single one of the 700 plus who applied wrote something that was telling me they couldn't actually see what the biggest problem they had with their channel was so now myself and Aaron who's been helping film Booth clients grow are going to review some of these Brave applicants who sent in their channels and enable you and them to spot the warning signs of this gigantic problem that will stop your Channel Growing in 2023 if you don't fix it so this first channel we're going to look at is from Caitlyn and she's got a cooking channel um she wrote in her form that her biggest struggle right now is a view count and she said I'm having some videos Peak at 40 but others are reaching 100 plus look there's a lot of different reasons why some videos get more views than others but we're just going to look at one thing in particular now to help you solve this Aaron yes I've got this image on screen this is one of Caitlyn's thumbnails in terms of this video what do you think the most important thing for the viewer is to see the end result of the food and what do you think as a result of that the biggest problem with this image is that stopping it getting clicks well it's getting covered up by text and colors so it doesn't really show off the food the way you would want it to that's it it's simplest form that is one of your biggest problems you've got on your Channel right now in all of your thumbnails you're covering the thing the viewer cares about so the simplest way to fix this is to do what this lady's doing the Domestic Geek so Aaron is there anything that sort of you find appealing about the domestic Geeks I mean I'm instantly like my mouth is watering right especially with all the different um you know iced coffees and milkshakes but it's just showing you with like a simple clean image and you know nice and vibrant colors what the result is going to be I'm instantly hungry any other thoughts on uh Caitlyn's thumbnails showing result is probably stronger than showing the process because this one has like more ingredients on it than other things so um really finding a way to show off a hero of your thumbnail so of what people are going to be clicking on but if we use an example of this image here instead of showing the house you're showing the bricks and no one's going to buy a house based on the bricks so perfect point there Aaron all right so there's one more thing we just want to touch on and it's your titles um what do you think is a problem with the title like this well the thing for me is they feel a little bit search based which makes sense in a way but if you really want people to quickly you know see a thumbnail that's striking and then click on a title is you want to add in some kind of intrigue or something that's a little more powerful than just like here's four recipes you really want to draw them in with something like incredibly tasty or super unique or the secret to the best cakes or something like that yeah so what we've got here we want to be keeping our targets below 50 characters if possible so you've got four tasty breakfast recipes which is a good start and then you've made it really specific using Pillsbury dough now what if they're like ah I'm not really interested in Pillsbury day but they should be and actually in the video If you showed them how to use it they might be super interested in it so you kind of have to break down objections viewers might have to clicking on your content and make sure that you're not including anything that might put them off so four tasty breakfast recipes your kids will love if that was your avatars and if they had kids that's the sort of title that would be enough everything else that came across especially full dishes episode two where you've put episode two in that's gonna kill the video of everyone who hasn't seen episode one okay so next up we have MC Metro and they said the problem was this I always feel I have a healthy subscriber count however it's not necessarily proportional to the Views so let's have a look at the channel to see if we can establish how we can help with this so Aaron the second you land on this channel what do you think they could do to get more of their subscribers to come back to their content well really kind of figuring out how to make what you're showing off look nice again it comes back to that hero that we were talking about like these in a way look just like toys whereas you know if you really get in there and figure out like a nice angle with a nice background you can show it off in a way that looks a lot more impressive because these people are obsessed with mini trains anyway so that's what you want to show off yeah so I would think about it like this what to your viewers is the most interesting and fascinating thing about model Railways now I'm going to take a complete guess here Aaron I'm going to get you to take a guess too actually Aaron you guessed first what do you think the most interesting thing to people who like model Railways is how realistic they can look yeah so to me I kind of feel like maybe they love the tiny little details on a train or on a house that make it look super real so the first thing you should be doing when you're coming up with a new thumbnail is researching and looking at other people's thumbnails within your Niche or maybe even outside it too so I did a little bit of an explore and I found a channel who's really doing well uh they're called play London so how to pronounce that but this guy you know 70 000 views on a Model Railway video that's that's pretty impressive stuff sticks out to you about these thumbnails Aaron it looks incredibly realistic the one on the top right I'm like is that even is it fake is it tiny the one below it as well I'm like that just looks like a station until you see the person on the right you know it's it's also incredibly realistic which is really powerful with diorama building yeah I I would click on that as someone who has no interest in this Niche because I can't quite make out if it's real or not and again it goes back to photography here so this this image in particular they've taken this shot with their backgrounds blurred out which makes it look even more realistic right this could be a Hilltop so I think they have really picked up nicely on what the viewers care about and again no no real text on these images it's they're very very simple and you're you know putting some effects and and things on the images but also I think have a play with your lighting as well and and bring up the brightness slightly so that these things stick out a little bit more so next up we have Nikita and he said his problem is attracting new viewers because his Niche is fairly small and limited let's start with the first thing that you can probably get more views with Aaron is there anything that jumps out straight away yeah I mean depending on the angle you want to take you're going again for something that's quite Niche obviously Lord of the Rings is something that is kind of getting popular with the Amazon show coming out but there are other things about beer brewing that are probably even wider uh form of Interest right something like Oktoberfest or another beer brewing Festival is gonna bring in more people with the relevant interest compared to Lord of the Rings yeah so I think you've made the right choice in that you've tried to Target a trend here but the wrong choice in the is law of the Rings associated with beer that much going back and looking at your ideas there are some that work here but I think you've taken a bit of a wild card approach here with the lord of the ring ones I think you should be looking at these other channels so we've got this one called claw hammer and they get quite a lot of views on their videos you know 165 000 in a month is a lot Aaron is there any sort of pattern that you notice straight away which is helping them get those sort of views yeah I mean the thumbnails are quite clear and quite simple you know obviously they're going to the extreme into like expired beers dangerous to drink barely legal but on top of that again we're coming back to that hero in the thumbnail right it's showing off the brew that you're going to be talking about so you tend to find extremes always do well on YouTube Brewing the strongest Homebrew allowable by law you wanna know what happens right and a few things fire up in your mind like what does someone drink it like how strong is it would I be able to drink that and that makes the thumbnail and title really intriguing and highly clickable so these guys have got some fun ideas I think your channel is very much targeted to the people who are already very very interested and that always makes your audience a little bit smaller Aaron if you're going to redesign five things I wish I knew before I started Brewing as a thumbnail and that's a strong title yeah what do you think you'd put in it either something that is super obvious that everyone does when they start brewing or something that is very clearly a mistake um and then have something like some text or an arrow pointing at it saying like don't do this or something like that and I think I just want to talk to you about the thumbnail design is Aaron what does your eye notice as soon as you see this what's the first thing that sticks out to you um things yeah and what is the first thing do you think that should stick out to someone in a video about Brewing brewing equipment or hops something like that yeah something related to the thing they care about that is visually clear so maybe this here maybe this thing here you've covered how do we get around using text if we wanted to stick with this so it doesn't stick out first and stop us from seeing the things that we should actually notice well like I said something like arrows can really help making texts just a little bit smaller um but generally like having the thing that is actually relevant be either in the middle of the frame or a focal point somewhere so really we wouldn't be able to show much of your face here but like this is the interesting bit here so it's getting used to sort of design and photography again one of the things to keep in mind as well is like if something's really small in the corner it might not immediately be obvious what it is to me those could be coffee beans and I would be like yeah sure but they're not right and you want to make that clear I thought they were coffee beans as well actually okay so this next channel is Tim and it's been an interesting problem he said he had or a struggle he said his biggest struggle was on camera presence and I say it's not on camera Presence at all Tim you are a street photography Channel Aaron as a street photography Channel what do we need to see in these thumbnails street photography and as much as these are amazing images right it doesn't give us the contact as to what it is um a lot of the photos just are like reflections of things and you know things through glass or in the rain but if you want to show off street photography it's great to have that context rather than having London or Bristol as a word having you know London at night or Bristol streets or whatever it is in the image is really going to help you get that across more I know that your style is a bit more abstract but look here it's from Jason vong five prices street photography tips so he's got this thumbnail uh where the guy in the orange jackets contrasting it looks like a street in its simplest form I found another one as well that I thought was really clear street photography this is from someone called Pierre and scope by is most viewed here you know five must know street photography tips he's in the street on the floor so one thing I think you should try is this you don't necessarily need to leave your sort of abstract style but in this latest video how to use Reflections to add depth and layers Aaron what would you do if that was you well so I probably either not use text or have it in a way that's a little bit more meaningful and then make it more obvious that it's a reflection because I can see it but I don't know if it's clear to anyone else who is looking at this with you know less of a photography background it looks amazing but I don't know what I'm looking at necessarily Aaron anything you want to add on the titles yeah I mean as you can kind of tell right that almost all of these are being cut off which probably means they're a little bit long again really rather than just leading with street photography or you want to build a question in the mind of the person seeing your thumbnail in titles so again something that is size something short that really like emphasizes the point you're talking about secret to amazing Street night photography or something along those lines it's going to be more powerful than street photography at night in London yeah you're kind of like saying exactly what it's about we need a bit more Intrigue there so then our final Channel biggest struggle here was how to break through the 10K views faster per video If you want to get more views faster you need more clicks guess what we're going to be looking at right now I wonder if it's titles and thumbnails it is the biggest Blocker on YouTube hopefully by now you're starting to see a pattern as a viewer Aaron what are the problems with these thumbnails so this is about kite surfing right and people who love kite surfing love the action of it the feeling of it you know the wind and the waves and the season really showing much of that action text is covering things there's you know bits and pieces different pictures in one image I want to see just like you on a kite surfboard is that what it's called having the best time of your life because that's the thing people want to connect to when they're not kitesurfing right as opposed to someone walking on a beach that's not necessarily relevant as much to that person so this is a thumbnail yeah uh or just type in kite surfing on Google these images you're selling people the dream that's why you need to show them the thing that they love and at the moment it's just too clogged up especially this one in particular this is committing a crime I call the inside joke so if you put something in your thumbnail image that the viewer will only understand once they've watched your video it's not helpful to get a click so you've got Morpheus but why is he in the thumbnail I think get rid of him get rid of all the text have just this nice shot of you kite surfing maybe pump the saturation up a little bit and play with the contrast and you're gonna break way more views so then let's have a look at the titles here as well keep your hair dry while kiting uh again is a title that feels long and has a whole chunk that isn't necessarily relevant or building that Intrigue you know kinds of interesting transition in three steps might just be enough on its own I still feel like there might be a more powerful way of really getting people to be like oh I want to click on this because it's something that they recognize or something that makes it feel like you know something they don't but yeah again like is keeping your hair dryer just about getting wet or not so keeping your hair dry is is going to be a term for not falling in okay this is about kite surfing transitions you can do that mean you won't fall off you could probably just show a comparison and I talk about these thumbnails a lot because it's so powerful left hand side of the screen show the thing they shouldn't be doing with the cross right hand side show the thing they should be doing or the left hand side could even just be you on the kiteboard trying to get back on soaking wet and the one on the other side is you having a great time with dry hair if you say keep your hair dry it doesn't necessarily instantly mean that much unless that is a term within the niche that everyone understands what about the new people who don't thank you so much to our brave applicants you all will be sent 100 as a thank you and if you want to sign up for my next Channel review video and get the ability to have your questions answered and exclusive content then check out the link below but more importantly make 2023 the year you take your thumbnails to the next level because it really is one of the ultimate reasons channels don't grow but also you want to be making sure that the experience you give your viewers once they hit play absolutely blows them away how the heck do you do that well there are three really powerful tools any YouTuber no matter how small can use and you can learn what they are in only 7 minutes and 34 seconds simply by watching this video here next

Finally, we have reached 50k subscribers, and for that, thank you so much. But the average views on my channel are just 10 to 15k. Because 3.7 million videos are uploaded Everyday On YouTube 3.7 million In Hindi-language educational content, the RPM (Revenue per Mile), meaning the earnings per 1000 views, is around 10 to 40 rupees. But in foreign countries, or the content that people from abroad watch in English, their RPM is 300 to 800 rupees. You'll find thousands of tutorials on YouTube about how people earn lakhs of rupees, and thousands of motivational videos. But this video is going to be the exact opposite —more like a demotivational one. Motivating someone for the short term is no big deal. That can even be done just with sound design. But that won’t actually have any impact on your life or change your quality of life. The feeling I have after three years, you shouldn't have that. In 2024, choosing YouTube as a career? It could prove to be a big mistake. By creating content on youtube for 2-3 years and by observing fellow creators. I’ll be sharing what I’ve learned And yes, if you're afraid of reality and want to become like those motivational speakers, making money by any means possible, then stop watching this video right now, and don’t forget to hit the dislike button. If you open Instagram or watch any podcast where money is being discussed, you’ll immediately start feeling like a loser. Because nowadays, no one seems to have an income of less than 5 lakhs on social media. Even if you’re earning ₹1 lakh, you’ll still feel like a beggar, because those people are earning 10-15 lakhs per month, and that too at the age of 20. Some are just 13 years old, and some haven’t even come out of their mother’s womb yet. To prove this, they won’t show you their bank balance or their real method of work. by just looking at the dark circles under their eyes, you’ll have to understand They’ll tell you about some mind-blowing business model like dropshipping, video editing agencies, YouTube automation, etc. Tech Burner said something very valuable: "there’s a huge difference between being good and showing on the internet that you’re good." Because of these reels and countless podcast clips, the illusion that’s been created—stay away from it. Otherwise, it will distract you a lot and steal your peace of mind. You won’t even be able to make decisions, and then you’ll end up following their roadmap. Finally, I quit my job and going to live dream life. I left everything for passion— this is becoming a common phrase now. But think about it: a 9 to 5 job doesn’t inherently mean it’s bad. You also need skills and hard work to get it. Make decisions not in excitement but with responsibilities in mind. God gave us enthusiasm along with Brain; sometimes you should use that too. 9 to 5 jobs are called the rat race because you have to follow the same boring routine every day. So, why am I now calling YouTube a rat race? Let's go back a little. I started my YouTube channel out of passion, a passion for clicking photos. When I grew a little, I started making content for the audience because I wanted to grow more. This way, photography faded away. I completely stopped going outside with my camera. I had to shift my full attention towards videography, and I started enjoying that too. But again, to grow in this field, I had to keep doing the same work repeatedly. I started uploading one content piece every week. Gradually, the scripts for the videos became more complex, the editing process became more time-consuming, and now I’ve reached a point where it takes me two to three days to write a script, and it takes me three days to edit a video. So now, what's happening is that I’m spending the entire day in front of the computer screen, locked in a room. After a few days like this, a word starting with “p” completely disappeared. I had said in a video that I’m very happy turning my passion into a profession, but now I realize that’s not the case. Because think about it carefully —if you have to do something you once did out of your own will, but now you have to do it under pressure, repeatedly, your love for it will fade away. You love eating biryani, but if you are given biryani for lunch and dinner every day, after a week, just the name of biryani will make you feel nauseous. This creates the feeling of burnout. Now, some people can balance this life and keep growing with that mindset. And then they fall into the same rat race, which is no different from a 9-5 job, or even worse. Because for the job, you were mentally prepared in advance that you’d have to do this. But for this career, you expected something entirely different. To sustain this, you need capability, which varies from person to person. It would have been easier to sustain if the rewards were better. I’ve already mentioned how much the RPM is for educational content in Hindi. So, if you still want to get trapped in this rat race, do it by being mentally prepared. Look at my situation at first I used to upload four videos in a month, then three, and now I’ve stopped at two. I don't know, maybe it will become one someday. And even now, I’m able to upload this content the only reason  is because of sponsors. And this video is sponsored by HitPaw Video Enhancer, which allows you not only to enhance any video but also repair various types of damages, whether it's flickering, unplayable videos, screen loss, or even restoring sound. So, let's test the video enhancer. Click on 'Import Video File' and select your low-resolution video. Since it's a face video, the automatic face model has already been selected here. Now, just click on 'Preview Effect'. In just a few seconds, the preview will be ready. The enhancement has been done really well, but the color has gotten a little messed up, so we will exit the preview and select 'Soften' for the face model, then tap on 'Preview' again, and as you can see, now it's enhanced perfectly. The original video was in 240p, and we have converted it to 4K. Now, we'll just export it from here. Now, let's look at AI Background Removal. Import a video from here, and after playing the video, you'll notice that it has complex movements. It will be interesting to see how the background is removed in this. Now, just tap on 'Preview'. In a few seconds, you'll get the video with a transparent background, and you can also check the accuracy. You can apply any color to the background from here. Now, just click on 'Export'. Be sure to check out the link in the description for full details. 5-10 years ago, when there weren’t as many smartphone users, everyone used to say, 'You just need one viral video.' Meaning, if one video on your channel goes viral, you’ll be established. But today, that has completely changed. Today, having a viral video isn’t a big deal. Subscriber count has no value today. In the early days, there were a limited number of creators in every niche. That’s why the audience used to subscribe to them and only watch their videos. They would build a brand. But today, in every niche, there are millions of creators. If someone likes one of their videos, they immediately hit subscribe, but no one watches all their videos. Now people have many options, and now there’s also Shorts. So, just watching Shorts consumes the entire day. So now, through long-form content building a brand and identity has become very difficult. Let me show you proof. Alright, maybe I make bad content, that’s why my average views are low. But Anithing has 7 lakh subscribers, and their average views are between 1 lakh and 3 lakh. NSB Pictures has 14 lakh subscribers, but the average views are still between 1 lakh and 3 lakh Ankit Bhatiya has 10 lakh subscribers, and his average views are 2 to 3 lakh. Besides that, many good channels are posting fewer videos due to burnout and the huge fluctuation in views. The simple truth is that the immature audience enjoys being fooled. And if you try to build a brand through short-form content, how many brands will people remember? On Instagram, anyone with 10,000 followers considers themselves to have built their own brand. So today, building a brand and a strong audience base is impossible. Views will always fluctuate a lot, no matter how authentic you are. You must have seen this concept, where a carrot is dangled in front of a donkey, and to eat it, the donkey starts walking and keeps walking. But it never actually reaches the carrot. The owner by using that one carrot, takes advantage of the donkey's struggle Similarly, there are some people who want many struggling creators to exist. And they also have just one carrot, which is the skill of manipulating people's thoughts. 'How to grow your YouTube channel,' 'How to make money.' 'How to make viral videos,' Okay, let's say I'm wrong. But think about it, if their advice actually worked, then why is there a need to make more videos on the same topic? But if you check their channels, Then the first video is: 'How to complete 4000 hours of watch time.' Then, after 2-3 videos: 'How to complete 4000 hours of watch time in one day.' Then, after another couple of videos: 'How to get 4000 hours of watch time with just one video.' Why is there a need to keep doing this? The more you struggle, the more they benefit. You are the product. They'll teach you how to get views on your videos but can't get views on their own videos. These people want as many struggling creators as possible, who will watch their videos to escape the struggle and keep watching forever. My channel only started growing when I stopped following their channels. Mr. Beast always says, 'Just focus on creating the best possible video, that's it.' In their business model, if you want to make money, all you have to do is fool people. Even if you're making 30,000, teach people how to make 500,000 per month. And one thing I don't understand, if a person knows 122 ways to earn millions, why aren't they doing those things themselves? Instead, they're teaching you. It's all about the RPM, dear, the RPM trap. Isn't this something like Ambani quitting business to open a YouTube channel and teach you how to make millions from the telecommunication business? If you don't know anything, just teach people how to make money. So please, stay away from these real vampires who are turning your struggle into their business. Just as not everyone with a white beard is a guru, similarly, people who don’t look at the camera while speaking into a studio mic aren’t necessarily worthy of giving advice. Some advice sounds good but is actually useless. For example: Always be surrounded by rich-minded people; you’ll become like those you associate with. So, if someone’s parents are poor, should you kick them out of your house? a friend who has been with you since childhood just because he is poor or have a poor mentality Will you abandon him ? Advice-givers will only keep giving advice (like me). In difficult times, a friend will be more useful. Life is a race. If life is a race, then the one who dies first wins. So, just die now. Forget this nonsense. Life is life; live it well. What success means to you is something only you will decide. No one eles You can be happy even with less money. Not everyone needs bungalows and BMWs to be happy. Some people are very happy earning 15-20 thousand and living with their family. So stop taking advice from everyone. Try to spend time with family and friends. Remember one thing, you can always earn more money, but the time that has passed cannot be brought back. Respect even a poor person; this is life, and they have experience. Free advise Whatever you do, don't think of building a career solely by starting an editing channel. Freelancers are now looking to shift to full-time YouTube, and creators are looking for freelance work. Living on one bank of the river always makes the other bank look better. After struggling for 3 years, and then changing your decision it's better to be prepared beforehand. There’s no need to leave anything to create content on YouTube. If you have a job, continue with it and do YouTube alongside it. All of these points might not apply to you if you make videos in the entertaining niche. However, if you want to create educational content as a video editor, it’s better to allocate 40% of your time to it while doing other work as well. I am also doing some freelancing work today and thinking of doing something offline as well. Just like COVID-19 halted offline work for a while, some incident might also stop online work Now, every situation has exceptions; if you are very talented, your situation might be different. But I am speaking from the perspective of an average person. And I hope this helps my 10 to 12k viewers In this video, I’ve discussed a lot of good and bad points, with the sole aim of helping some people make their decisions better. So if anyone feels bad about my comments, I sincerely apologize. And for creating different moods in every part of this video, I used different types of lighting, which will also improve your visual storytelling if you watch my cinematography series videos. See you soon in the next video. Until then, bye.

====== Estudo_Especialista_139_What Is Working on YouTube Now  (10 Trends) ====== 
excited for this stream because we're going to be talking about 10 viral trends that you need to try and really what's working on YouTube right now we've done a lot of research and I'm going to be joined today by Nate from the think media team who's crushing it on YouTube in his own right making videos on this channel filmmaker and who also has been to some events recently kind of in the YouTube industry so we've done hours of research we've gone deep analyzed our own channels and you can check out time codes and chapters to find um the different distinct trends that we are going to be covering and so uh Nathan welcome to the stream you want to dive us right into your presentation and then I'll cover my five Trends in part two absolutely thank you so much for having me so Sean sent us out to vid Summit which is host in Dallas Texas and this is my second year going and got a lot of great resources out of this year in particular so I want to talk a little bit about what is working on YouTube specially this year but also going further and Beyond 2024 and some of the latest trends that different people have covered so let's go ahead and let's dive straight into it so this was a big light bulb moment for me we had Todd bupre kind of like the algorithm guy behind YouTube explaining most creators think when I ask you like what do you think the YouTube algorithm is you know you might think once I post up a video is going to try to put that video where it wants to go and try to get as much views as possible well that's the wrong way to look at it YouTube does not look at the algorithm like that instead the reality is they look at YouTube very much for the viewer so when you log on to YouTube as a consumer you're watching it it's going to try to figure out what videos you're interested in so the algorithm is really dependent on each person watching your video Someone side by side is not going to get the same recommendations as you do no matter how good your video is so we're going to talk a few things about how it chooses to put out your video but first that's just a big relight you know we need to stop thinking about how YouTube is trying to make our Channel popular instead we need to dive and think okay how do we focus in on the viewer how do we make sure that we make content that they are actually going to want to watch because that's a b thing so getting in that Fram set I think is the automatic shift for me that I'm like oh you know we hear it so much but sometimes you just need that little encouragement like that real little reset so let's dive into the different reasons or how YouTube chooses to show what videos are seen on the homepage so number one they always say is rule-based recommendations so it's going to look at the viewer subscriptions what videos did they recently watch what are some of the high performing content in that Niche or your audiences are watching so it's going to choose that fundamentally so subscribers are still important you know if you subscribe to a channel that is a good notification that you want more content like that so still encourage people to subscribe if they do enjoy watching that content number two is word of mouth or what they call automated word of mouth so the way they described it is if you go to a movie and let's say you just watched alien Romulus and you loved it well you might go tell your friend hey I think you should watch alien it was amazing um so you now just referred another person to watch that video what YouTube does is it's automatically doing that it's going to kind of predict which a viewer is going to be interested in that same topic and if you watch a video you watch it all the way through you thumbs it up and you share it that's just more indication that it's going to find that similar audience um so if you think about the different viewer and what they're interested in you know if you're this is a big question too people are thinking about is what if I want to change niches or change topics well there are chances that they're interested in other similar things so if I do a video about film making there's a good chance that people are interested in movies or other things like that and I just don't have to be stuck in gear reviews if that makes sense the third method is algorithmic personalization so again it's tailoring each video based off the viewers unique interest and viewing habits even beyond the YouTube platform which was a little concerning because YouTube they're a data company and so they they they have a lot of data and so they can kind of tell based off your interest your demographics what interest you might have in general if you're more sportsy if you like to go on Hikes it can kind of defer what videos are going to be seen around them so those are a few ways that YouTube chooses what video is going to be placed on that home feed or the suggestions feed what I also recommend um and this was another thing that was really quite interesting is if you ever opened up your YouTube studio and you scroll through and you see related videos and where are all your views coming from so people are watching a video and they go to click on your video there is a setting YouTube has in there where it will show the related videos it's suggesting I've noticed this for a long time that I would to get really weird recommendations like it was totally different from my Niche and I was thinking man YouTube just does not understand my audience or my channel but the way they described it makes it makes a lot of sense sometimes if you subscribe to a channel you may not watch a video immediately you know you you may not watch on the subscription feed box but you might see it as a suggestion and you might click on that so in the same way we would watch TV and we would change channels right people have that same viewing pattern so we will go from watching aliens and we'll go to watching uh cooking recipes you know on a dime just because we're interested in that topic so do keep that in mind if your kind of algorithm doesn't seem like it's working it's actually just viewer behavior and that's all you YouTube is really trying to do is just cater to the viewer and what they're interested in and sometimes it seems a little weird but ultimately we're getting closer to what the viewer actually wants to watch Sean do you have anything you want to say there no I love it I'm just gonna hang out I will say as we're talking about Trends and for those that are just jumping on um you're hitting this first one here and I've got five towards the second half and so we're talking about the YouTube algorithm misconception versus reality and um ultimately I've learned lately that consumption is the new subscription and so it kind of ties into this where the YouTube algorithm the most valuable currency these days is someone watching a YouTube video almost more so than someone clicking this subscribe button because if someone clicks subscribe it doesn't mean they're seeing your videos but if somebody's watching your videos it actually probably does mean YouTube's going to suggest more of your videos so more valuable than a subscri these days is minutes of watch time and consumption and this kind of just ties into how the algorithms working have you noticed that as well Nate definitely that's actually what they kind of talked about is the um long form being such a huge proponent I'm G to skip forward here uh long form just being on the rise because I feel like this for myself when I'm watching I might have YouTube on my TV I'm in a different viewing pattern where you know a few years ago it would took it a lot for me to watch a 30 minute view video but now I just pop on a 30 minute long video and I'll be working you know just listening to a video it's very different than how we consume YouTube before and so and just kind of give a quick little preview Colin Samir actually talked about that being the key to success on YouTube is creating a relat a repeatable long form format and Sean I know you talked about you know creating one highquality valuable video per week you know if you can maintain that consistency and make it repeatable and make it kind of lengthy you're going to have a much better chance at getting that watch time more ad Revenue more likely for YouTube to suggest your video I feel like it's less competitive when you have a longer video when it's more in depth than just something short that you can easily put out yeah you know it's interesting I was watching this podcast uh called the deep end with Taylor Welch and before subscribing the simple fact that I started one of the episodes of video podcast and let it play now Taylor is following me everywhere including my shorts feed so he's in my shorts feed other videos are showing up your consumption like the way the algorithm Works we're tying in a couple Trends together so I'll kick it back to you but you're talking about the YouTube algorithm it's one of the big trends understanding how it works creating the right content and understanding viewer behavior and then I think the second one you're hitting is long form content is on the rise and uh we'd love to know Trends are you seeing if you're watching this um are you consuming more long form content just short form content but I'll kick it back to you for uh the next tip here yeah I'm just going to kind of briefly go back to the algorithm one thing that YouTube is actively working on is they're utilizing Ai and large language models to better understand what your video is about so if you ever notice you know captions pop out on your video or the transcription box that you know YouTube has a great understanding of what your video the context is so even when you mention if you craft a video for specific title keyword like we talk about then understanding what that video is is what the algorithm is trying to understand the best way they describe this is YouTube is instead of if they're serving out a video like a recipe they're not just following a recipe they're trying to like understand the mentality of like how to cook so like if you're interested in this particular topic maybe you want to go deeper on it or not just because it's titled similarly but it's in the same world so being able to understand more about what the individual is is going to help it put it in front of the audience so many times we're struggling getting the viewer to actually watch our video but just remember the other half of this YouTube is wanting for people to watch your video so they're trying their best to understand what your video is and so the more we can help about the algorithm by providing or you know just being more valuable and thoughtful of how we're presenting our video is also going to help combine with the power of YouTube to better understand the content and context of our videos and that's going to put it in front of the right people but now let's move on to long form content like I teached earlier so there's three really big reasons that they've noticed about long form video and when we mean long form video it can mean anything from like eight minutes plus but they kind of defined it as you know since 2020 um 20 plus minute long videos have been on the rise more AdSense more Revenue has been flowing into that and people are watching longer videos sometimes I get caught up watching you know a longer podcast two hours I'm like whoa you know that's totally different than what I used to watch back in the day so just keep in mind that you know having a longer video YouTube is incentivized to keep people on their platform so if a longer video is keeping people engaged they're going to likely recommend that over the last 16 months long form content has seen an rise in AdSense Revenue so that's why it's another indicator for why we should be making that we all want to earn money on this platform and that can be a stepping stone towards you know if you're planning to go full-time on YouTube and also viewer preference like people are just naturally wanting longer more in-depth content I think we've all been inundated with short form content and we watch it but I don't know about you but when I'm watching a short I find kind of feel gross after you know watching a 30 40 minutes and I don't feel satisfied but if I watch an hour and 30 minute long movie or two hour movie like I feel satisfied by that um and I think that's like a different thing we have to kind of keep mind is the longer video you can go more in depth you can be more personal and like we'll mention later on the stream is you can build more connection to your audience so those are all things you can utilize just keeping a note on long form is really the best place to be and like I mentioned earlier Colin Samir great YouTubers they were there speaking and something that they said really stood out to me the key to success on YouTube in 2024 is creating a repeatable long form format and Sean you've said something similar to that but I think that's very true and that's something we definitely experimented on our podcast channel on this channel and Sean you've been doing a lot more of these deeper Dives 20 minute long videos and releasing those every Wednesday like I think that is exactly what this is it's a repeatable long form format and you know you look at the viewership on those videos they're l more in depth people resonate with those and in turn YouTube is likely to recommend those as we've seen so that's long form let's talk about short form because I think there's two worlds we kind of have to be a part of and you know short form can be hard to necessarily grow and sustain for long form and people often ask us like how do you convert your shorts viewers to long form and that's kind of tricky because we've explained it before it's like two different people two different audiences right so what was interesting is creators who utilize shorts well see an average of 10% increase on their long form views so what does that mean it doesn't necessarily mean by posting shorts you're gonna get 10% more views but if we kind of take it step by step here one creator that was an example of this is Max fos so he does does like these YouTube pranks elaborate videos and he uses his YouTube shorts as a kind of a trailer for his longer video so he kind of give a brief 60- second synopsis of his video and then he like leaves the last hook like he's going to do something outrageous he says but click the link click the related short to watch the full thing and you might be divided on that but the idea is you know getting millions and millions of views from these shorts that are feeding to long form so he's a key example of you know while he is making a great shorts he's also making the long form and by people just watching the shorts YouTube is naturally going to recommend that long form video and you may not automatically switch to it each viewer who's watching shorts may not actually click the related shorts button but in general you're going to see an increase and they said roughly around 10% on average creators who are using shorts well will see that increase in their long form views which is super cool to see you have any thoughts on that yeah I've noticed that Trend as well certain shorts with good storytelling that not only hook me into the 60c version but are architected not just trimmed out of the longer video but create the open loop see the full video on the channel use the related um video feature to link to the long form video I think that from and you're mentioning Max fos as an example of this you know I think that one of the things we've noticed is it seems like it's a small percentage of people who click the related video and not even that we've been doing it at a world- class level but the simple fact is that shorts can get we have a short that just is over 10 million views so a small percentage of millions of views potentially or hundreds of thousands depending on your Niche if you're watching this it could still be a major impact in moving shorts viewers over to long form so I think that is a um a cool Trend and if you're just jumping on Nate's breaking down some of the insights he learned at vidsummit uh recently with uh darl EES and all the awesome speakers over there and then in the second part of this I've also got five Trends I've spotted and we're curious which one do you like best because whether that's tapping into shorts we've been talking about the personalization of the algorithm long form content on the rise and so um things you can apply to your channel to get better results in the coming weeks and months I see a quick question here that says what do you mean by repeatable that's a great question I kind of glanced over that but you know we can often make a long form video and we could do it really well but by the end of that video you're just exhausted you don't upload for months so what is an I would say a relatively easy way but if you think about your workflow of making a video what is something that you could actually repeat that could be a podcast that could be a longer Vlog that could be a sit down talking video if you want a good example of this I think Sean's did a great job with his Q&A videos he's been doing so like every Wednesday we've been dropping these videos and those are him talking in front of the camera yes there's some editing there's some Polish but fundamentally he's answering a question so I think that's a great way to start implementing this is looking at ways that you can actually come up with what we call a format something like a show you could repeat you know imagine if you watched Food Network and suddenly they're watching you know you suddenly you're watching Food Network and then all of a sudden you're watching something completely different on the show you wouldn't be tuned in so having that consistency really matters and here's a great example of those Q&A videos again yeah newest the newest show at thick media and I mean it's similar to other stuff but it's a format kind of dialed in with the workflow it's based off of one viewer question and then I spin up the episode around it of course for the season of life we're in blessed to have help with editing and whatnot but for any solo Creator the the the question being what does repeatable mean I think sustainable it's like that you don't you can only make one video a year because you had to all the Blood Sweat and Tears and fatigue that it took that's one reasons why video podcasting is so popular is because it's sustainable if you're interviewing other people or whatnot you don't have to always be coming up with your own original ideas you just need to book guests and have good questions so I think that's a deep question to ask yourself what is a repeatable long form show or what is a repeatable sustainable content format for your channel that can help you grow but also not burn out in the process love it let's head back into the slides here and again here's another demonstration of just the increase 10% on long form um we're gonna talk about a little bit of hook structure and just how do you you might earn the viewers click but how do you actually keep them watching so there's three key elements that they were talking about and really you need to capture your audience ATT attention within the first five to 10 seconds so we've heard you know first 30 seconds but really it's that 5 to 10 seconds where they want to know are you going to fulfill on the promise that they clicked on you know if you titled a video best camera for YouTube and then the first few seconds is talking about something completely different people are likely going to click off so engaging making it interesting can be another thing visually interesting you know using sound effects or whatnot but really just understanding what your viewer clicked on the video for then we talk about story a compelling narrative that keeps keeps your viewers engaged and invested this is a big thing that I heard multiple times is storytelling storytelling what does that mean for a YouTube video especially since most of us are in the education space now I'm a little biased I'm a filmmaker I like telling stories but I myself I was like questioning like all right how do I bring in story to like a gear video right when's the appropriate time for that well if we distill storytelling and we just think of it as change right that could be a change of mindset that could be a change I've had this problem and now I fixed it you know towards the end that is an element of change in storytelling so I think you can kind of one thing I really try to be mindful of when I'm making YouTube videos is just being in the shoes of that viewer so if there's a paino if they're talking about I did a video called how to edit a YouTube video for beginners right I'm edited for several years now so maybe I've lost a little bit of touch of those pain points that seem so natural now right but if I can put myself in the shoes of those who've never touched editing at all they don't know what certain words mean you know they don't know exactly how to um they may be following along but they not understand the certain words you're using so to really like distill down what's the pain point of my viewer and identif in that and if you can provide that Solution that's also a form of story and then the payoff you know if you provide that solution to the viewer you know there's a sense of relief there's a sense of accomplishment now they don't have that problem or that burden anymore so I think that's like an easy way for an educational to incorporate some video structure that's going to keep people engaged um back off a little bit let's talk a little bit more about story I think we're hearing this more and more um about storytelling on YouTube and there were some great filmmakers at vidsummit and they're talking about um most YouTube videos you know we're great on teaching people the information but we don't necessarily there's a whole other side of humans not just the knowledge but it's it's the feeling the emotion and you can tap into that as a Creator how do you want the viewer to feel while watching your video if it's a comedy channel hopefully you want to make them laugh if it's an educational video you want to make them feel understood safe and that they can actually learn and digest the video they don't feel like an idiot you know those are a few good places to kind of try to focus on how you want your viewers to feel um I'm gonna switch topics a little bit Sean unless you have anything last to say we'll head into some thumbnail critiques and what's working but do you have any last thoughts on that no I love it you're you're dropping fire and if you're getting value you can smash the like button for the YouTube algorithm and Shout out if you're here live or on the replay and um we're talking about 10 different Trends we've spotted and I'll recap them in a bit and I've got five that I'm sharing myself in part two these are some things we've been testing and that you can test as well so as you're watching this video or you are just jumping on and you watch the replay um there's some big changes on YouTube so tapping into some of these Trends is a good way if maybe you're plateaued not getting views right now how can you reinvent your content maybe try something new and so with that yeah let's hit the next Point um in your deck here I forhad outed storytelling and we'll come back to that see a number of comments but let's quickly dive into thumbnails and the thumbnails that are working it's been very interesting year because we kind of seen some things that's actually I think beneficial to a beginner and that's like people are wanting authentic real thumbnails it's quite interesting so we've done a number of tests I've stole tekashi slides here so forgive me but he has a great demonstration he's been a testing different thumbnails that we've noticed that's working for us so here's a side by-side demonstration you know this side is like extremely cluttered a lot of text you know and then it's a you know perfect background like it's different colors bright so people you know people are trying to create those thumbnails to get people's click but what we found is that there's a more clean style that people are actually really engaging with so we've done a number of ab tests and for one video we come up with three different thumbnails and time and time again a simple clean photo is working simple clean photo of a camera no text you know this is probably more minimal of alab doll this went straight up no text just Sean and what's interesting is you know we're got great thumbnail designers on our team and so we're diving into this but we're noticing that people like the authentic in 2024 like people want a realistic photo or a thumbnail and I think that's just comes from like we're constantly tricked we're not sure what to believe and if you see a thumbnail that's just really open and just sincere like you can see your background I think it does say something fundamentally one thing that um Dave altiser he was touching touching on thumbnails he was talking about Simply Having like the same clothes as you are wearing the video is enough to like that little thing can be enough to just reinforce to the audience like hey you know this is a legitimate video like you're wearing that same piece you're being authentic um it's just a better representation of your video If we go back to the movie example right you know if videos are like movies our thumbnails should be like posters right you want a poster that's actually going to be true to what the movie is going to be but also you want it to look nice you know you want to be sharp you want to be interesting and engaging but we're finding that there's definitely been a shift towards if we're on a pendulum at least we're shifting towards more authentic so I think the key takea away from this is if you have a great title and idea strong basic clean and authentic thumbnail will actually work so what does this mean for viewers I think it simply means like if you're doing a talking head video as if you know I was talking to camera I think that means you don't necessarily have to have like cut yourself out and have a super clean background you could leave it kind of like as your background and then just do some simple text to reinforce your video that's something we've seen Al AB doll just really hone in on and it's working well um so yeah it's like little things like that have been just key to be more like if you're thinking about a Creator and a viewer it does make sense to Showcase what we're actually watching so again time and time again we're seeing on our homepage you can look through our Channel you might start seeing some cleaner more minimal photos sometimes just shine an interesting expression you know very subdued expression but that's sometimes enough to create that Intrigue um we're going to dive into storytelling but Sean do you have any kind of thoughts on this era of having simpler less Desy thumbnails yeah I think I think there's a couple things that's interesting um you know later on we'll talk a little bit how we are in the authenticity Revolution meaning people are just kind of burnt out on certain things like so they just get burnt out on maybe overpromises or overly hyped things and so a lot of times the the trends that happen on YouTube and almost in anything are pendulum swings I mean there's Trends in fashion right now the genes go from skinnier to baggier and then back to skinnier and so it was all skinny jeans paint on jeans now it's like bell bottoms and like fullon skater baggy jeans are back this is a fact and I'm here for it you know as a 90s kid uh you know skateboarding birdhouse baggy jeans what's the point so sometimes maybe certain thumbnail styles working in a season and a lot of times knowing when the timing is to sort of do the opposite so I think that minimalist and simple thumbnails are working because of it kind of just being the opposite of what we've seen and also um just being sometimes different we're trying to stop the scroll so when you maybe have seen you know it's a pattern interrupt as well like how do you do a pattern interrupt if you're used to seeing the same thing over and over we develop what's called ad blindness it's like if there's banner ads in your email inbox box or something like that you see them at first and they maybe used to work but now you just don't even notice them you just even your brain kind of rewires so we're always thinking about as creatives and as YouTube creators just kind of what's Happening next and what's where's the pendulum swinging next but I think it's also about testing and experimenting I know for some um maybe sometimes typically female channels might have we we always say have simplistic text but they might have more cursive emotional fonts wow I'm going to get slaughtered in the comments uh you know maybe more collage of like a day in the life and that like really works and so you always have to know what's happening in your Niche um and that still might be working there so I think kind of studying your Niche but these are some broad Trends in terms of what we're seeing in thumbnails and I'm curious what people's experience is as well before I bury myself let me kick it back to you Nate for this next point that you got well I think you brought up a good point about you youve often said many times different is better than better and I noticed scrolling on my YouTube TV you know I'm I saw half of Sean's shoulder and just because it was like so different like it made me scroll over oh yeah like you know I edited that video but it was enough to eye catch me you know and it was so different than all the other noise out there so instead of just simply thinking about making good thumbnail what's a way you can stand out so go type in the video you're making on YouTube and see what thumbnails people are making how can you make yours stand out so that's a simple and easy tip we do have a question I thought I completely replace the other one I'm sorry but uh I thought this was interesting is it worth uploading two thumbnails to test and I think here on think media that's what we are doing we're uploading three different thumbnails every time we upload and I think we're in the season of just capturing data right so we want to see okay what does work YouTube's given us the tools to see okay well we noticed the simple train that's how we were able to find out that trend of cleaner thumbnails because we could actually see that data was backing that so oftentimes you know I might have a preference of a thumbnail oh I want it this way someone else might have it this way but it's nice to have cold hard data to show you what's working and what can you derive from so I think yeah and I think not only if you can if you can utilize the test and compare thumbnail split test from YouTube you should and what you're seeing here is one we're running on yesterday's video on um this new trend is taking over vlogging now definitely tapping into Trend surfing and influence Surfing by having um you know different known people in the thumbnail but one thing to note is it's not just about click-through rate what it's ultimately about is and if you hover over this the winning thumbnail is generated by the highest share of the video's watch time so great thumbnails don't just get people to click they help the viewer or understand what the video is about so that they can make informed decisions about what to watch by selecting based on watch time share the winning thumbnail is the one that gets viewers to both click and stay and so the big key here is that um we're not just trying to get thumbnails only to like shock somebody or like well that's a little different so they click on it and then they get there and they're like okay cool that was different but I'm not going to stay or or we maybe clickbait and what people thought it was going to be it ends up not being that well if it doesn't lead to watch time It ultimately is not going to be the winning thumbnail on YouTube YouTube's eyes so I think it's thinking through the fact that title thumbnail um topic all work together in terms of packaging but even if you're click through rate someone asked earlier actually um and maybe in a different place like what would you uh it was on it was on the community tab by the way if you have a question that doesn't get answered today I have a post out I'm doing my next batch of our new series on the take media Community Tab and you could always post your question over there um and someone asked what would you choose CTR or avd click-through rate or average viation I I would choose average viation but it's kind of both like I would take a lower clickthrough rate with more average view duration rather than a higher clickthrough rate and no average view duration because minutes matter most on YouTube It's Time on platform that matters most and so anyways if you see this post on the think media Community tab um this is is where I'm capturing questions that I'll be turning into videos and shout out to uh 131 responses already but if you have a deep dive question and context one of the things I asked for was um up voting other people's questions a but also add details because it's one thing to be like how do I get more views I'm actually I'm probably not gonna answer that question because it's like well we have videos on the channel about it but if it's like how do I get views on my crochet channel that I've been doing for four years that I only have five hours week to do like if you give me some context then we could get into some interesting um content so anyways that's on the community tab we're talking about thumbnails back to you absolutely one last note about thumbnails I'll just point out we recently had a video and it was underperforming you know we had we were trying everything we could but people just weren't interested in it or just maybe the thumbnail wasn't clear enough and so you know we talked we workshopped it let's come up with a new thumbnail concept see if we can revive this video and totally different concept I think we kept um we might have changed title as well which is important to note in this equation but once we did the just the thumbnail swap we got it went from 33% average view duration to 66% average view view duration um which is huge that's like twice as people watching just based off a thumbnail so that can be another thing you're it takes a lot of effort to make a video takes a little bit less effort to make a thumbnail still a lot but if you can spend a little extra time to best create a poster for your video I think it's worth doing that and who knows a simple thumbnail swap might be key for you to get a lot more views and keep growing your Channel all right so we're gonna dive into next um we're going to talk about storytelling I brought it up earlier but this was a key thing that I kept hearing um over and over again I know a lot of you have comments about how do I apply storytelling well here's is a few things to keep in mind um again making your viewer feel can you spark empathy you know can you invoke curiosity maybe it's awe or you're cultivating hope tapping into Nostalgia these are a few different ways we can kind of just we can add a whole another flavor to our video if we just think about tapping into people's emotions so since many of us are educational people have problems they want to solve so perhaps you can spark empathy with that moment you know rather than being a know-it-all and be like oh you're an idiot do it this way you know sympathize with them and be like okay I remember what it's like to begin to edit a video I didn't know everything I want to be able to follow along and uh feel like I'm not being traded like an idiot but I'm learning and growing so having a positive attitude I think you can make people feel by tapping in being in the shoes is a huge thing I think a lot of us can start do um especially if you're creating like a hook right if you can identify a problem people are more likely to assume that you have a solution which is a very interesting kind of psychological thing um building curiosity there's a lot of great channels that are really tapping into this there's a YouTube channel called Preston goes and I watched a few of his videos he made a silly video about just like he built a railroad train track and he put it on a set of abandoned tracks and he wanted to go all the way across but he made that video feel so emotional because you get to see him pour His effort into making a cart and he's telling stories about how you know he's always wanted to do this or for whatever reason showing the hurdles obstacles he's gone through those are things that we all sympath like have experienced is you face an obstacle how are you going to avoid it how can you get over that and seeing people do it and achieve their goal we all celebrate in that so think about a few ways you know screenshot this if you want a few ways how you could tap into creating that so Sean is pulling up Preston goes I believe this is not Preston but Preston goes yeah he it's super interesting um definitely check out this channel if you want to learn storytelling um for your videos again who's looking up I built an underground go-kart not a lot of people but once you're familiar with him and you watch his videos like you're entertained because he's just telling stories and you might be asking yourself okay how do you put storytelling in a simple video well I think there's a lot of stories that we kind of discredit we don't think they're like we're not talking about Hamlet we're not talking about Shakespeare we're just talking about little Stories We would tell our friends and family so if I were you know let's just take a example here A buddy of mine wanted to learn video editing right actually I'll tell you this here's a real story my sister was trying to learn video editing and she said she was looking up resolve tutorials and she's like is there any good resources for editing because I've already made a video that's pretty in depth that shows a beginner from start to finish you know I was just able to send over that link and be like boom here you go like simple as that like I was in that moment where I've already done all the hard work I could just send a link and it felt genuinely good to be like oh you know I've help someone someone close to me and they are able to go the extra mile um and I didn't really have to do anything in that moment because I already done it at the beginning so that's a cool thing that we can have on our YouTube channels like the better you can help someone else like you don't feel bad about like helping people right so I think that's just like so key is learning those little anecdotes how can you apply those to your videos that make sense you don't want to go off tangents right but I think people long for that personal connection and the greatest way to that is telling simple stories Sean you're a storytelling expert do you have any tips for that well um you know I actually would dive into this question to kind of also talk about sort of two different types of content I think that Grace uh with the grid asks since Preston creates content out of the norm does he still need to focus on the description and tags as much you know in a case like Preston's Channel you in a way almost don't need to focus on the description of the tags at all because these are browse which is a traffic Source on YouTube algorithm hacking type of videos meant to they're a little bit longer entertainment can be suggested on TVs but all devices um and really we maybe talk about two big buckets of content there's suggested content and there's search based content so Grace and grit you know some types of channels it's knowing also not it doesn't always broadly fit into just entertainment and education but a lot of times it can as well so what's here's like an interesting illustration is you've got you know Preston over here with like my RC submarine explores a sunken aircraft carrier which is a 25 minute video that is like a masterpiece of editing and footage and thumbnail and packaging and retention and uh it got 1.8 million views we could also look at like we could go Microsoft word tutorial and entertainment versus education this video got the same amount of views as Preston 1.7 million views and uh the budget on this one's a little bit lower you know like this individual is not even on camera um they're just recording their screen they walk through a screen share now good education time codes chapters breaking it down so I think it's just knowing that YouTube is a diverse place and it depends on what you're trying to achieve and while this is also going to get an incredible amount of watch time because someone who watches this it's a complete course is going to click on this for the desire to learn this probably watch until the end and there's a lot of watch time as well speaks to viewer intent but I think more so title description and tags when someone is actively searching for something because a lot of the entertainment stuff Nate right like people don't know to search for these outlandish creative ideas that Mr Beast or Ryan tryan or pressor doing what what's actually happening it's algorithmic based it's like I'm just looking for something to watch whoa like I didn't know this jetpack was gonna work so good like you know like I might like jetpack it's a totally different approach to YouTube it's the it's the Brows suggested approach and there's also the search based approach and I think the the savest creators understand both methods tap into both methods and then choose which method they want to use depending on the video they're creating and so um it's really yeah it's not one or other being better it's really about different yeah absolutely and I going back down like being very practical something that I'm trying to actively solve for is like when should I find little bits of interjecting my humor into a video even if it is a camera tutorial I think people still like to have people like humor people like to laugh people like to hear stories um finding those moments where you can you know it's a attention resetter right so I think that is a great way is just incorporating more of your humor yourself into the video you know we're all very unique characters and so if we have our like own sitcom or whatnot you know find ways that make your character a little bit more unique versus just simply giving information I think that's there can only be one of you on YouTube so trying to better understand what makes you you is going to help your audience like naturally gravitate towards you you're not going to attract everyone but you will attract those and they will you know Bond and really dive in deep we got one more slide here where we're talking about um just more storytelling establishing a relatable character building suspense and tension I think a lot of times you know what's a certain tension people have or suspense like you are trying to solve a problem you do it one way like if Preston ising this cart and it fails miserably there's certain emotions that come with that and again unexpected plot twist like these are all things we can um inject into our videos but I'll really just boil it down to obstacles coming over those um knowing what the viewer is going through but fundamentally it's like we're not trying to create fake emotions like what are authentic emotions that are relevant in your video so like I'm not trying to Mr beastify you know like a YouTube tutorial right I'm trying to really just understand and what's its proper context so those all all those different elements is going to help people like that's just another method if you are beginning like this might seem way more advanced and to be honest like I haven't done all of these myself either but these are different trends that we've seen on YouTube like a lot of filmmakers are bringing like a slower Pace to YouTube um and Vlogs is the same way it's like it's a slower more intentional U letting you feel those emotions but if I had to like summarize the key to success for YouTube in 2024 Beyond number one focus on your viewer can you understand what they're going through what their interests are and just get a better picture a number when I was at vid Summit the number of creators that create their own channel avatars you know um they would create these personas of what their ideal viewer is what's their age what are their interest you know do they go to college or are they full-time um are they a mom are they a parent like the better you can understand your viewer you can start making content that they're going to be interested in I think we often limit ourselves onto the content we think people are interested just because we had one video do extremely well if I did an editing video and that's all I did you know there's a certain Niche for that but after a while you might feel like you want to expand different topics there's a good chance that they're are interested in those things and there's different ways you can smoothly transition and identify what our Niche is which if you want to dive into that we have different resources you can check out um but again I'll go back to the other success create a repeatable long form format again what's something you can consistently do on a basis that is longer form because people want to get to know you it's hard to get to know someone on a YouTube short because they 30 to 60 seconds or now 3 minutes but you can get to really know someone in an hourong video now I'm don't necessarily recommend starting out with an hourong video but if you are doing podcasts like can you create an intentionally video that's packed full value and should be that long you know don't waste people's time but if you can go deeper dive in more different aspects of that problem you're trying to solve that's all helpful again tell stories tell compelling stories they don't have to be great things but different things you've went through or hey I had this problem this is how I overcame it let me show you how to do that and then lastly focus on videos that are actively growing your audience um this is one piece of advice they gave is there's if you uploaded any number of videos there's probably good chance you could see where people were interested in right unless you have like zero views then we got to try something else but if you are if you have one video that did 100 views and the rest did 25 what's about that one that got 100 views and learning to not just necessarily repeat the video but follow up make a part two what's a video that can accompany that so those are all different ways that is going to help you create better videos in 2024 and ultimately get you more views so that way grow your channel um but yeah that's pretty much my recap of what we learned in bid Summit Sean do you have any ahas or takeaways well I want to get into those and in just a second I actually want to share five trends that I've spotted and we're noticing at think media as well if you're just jumping on definitely watch the replay because Nate just broke down really some powerful insights in terms of some of the things working on YouTube right now for getting views and how to make better content and so uh much more to come and um before we dive into kind of part two of the video if you're getting value it always means the world to us and the YouTube algorithm if you smash like and today's stream is brought to you by vid iq.com slink you can get a 30-day trial of vid iq's boost plan for just $1 and I asked you earlier when people were just jumping on the stream what niches are you in and one crafty gal said resin art is the niche that they are in and I actually want to show show you one cool tool here with vid IQ called outliers and so the big idea of what an outlier is is a video that is outperforming all the other videos on an individual's Channel and what's kind of cool about this tool is you could type in something like resin art which is one crafty gal's Niche here and we can look at now and see okay on these different channels this one right here was a 100x outlier that means that this particular video got a 100 times more views than the channels videos typically get and perhap perhaps you go oh wow I was just about to do a particular epoxy res table or something or maybe something not with seashells but that's similar even the way the title structured what can we learn about the thumbnails in almost every case there's no text on the thumbnails they're they're bright clear um pleasing images of what it is turning a free wasp nest into expensive art resinart there that's a 10x outlier and what you can actually do here is you can filter down to say okay I actually only only want to see channels that let's say have under 50,000 subscribers or something like it's one thing for a big channel to get a lot of views but maybe some smaller channels this channel has 5,700 subscribers and they got 82,000 views and 90 5x outlier here still getting 3.5 views per hour meaning this video still gets 3.5 views 24 hours a day 365 days a year and at three years old um and so that's a resent art sphere so you may be like different ways that again Inspire your next video and as we're talking about Trends and what's working on YouTube right now this is kind of one of the biggest Trends is this idea of being able to B what's happening jump on it quickly with your own version you it's not about copying somebody else but it's about drafting behind videos that are getting view velocity um it's one of the best thing ways to get views and grow your channel so that's just one of the many Suite of tools that vid IQ has if you've never tried it out the generate tool is pretty impressive it's pretty crazy you've got uh the keyword uh research tool still one of my favorites and ability to analyze competitors and stuff like that so if you want to try it out it's just $1 you could head to vid iq.com slink or you can um click the link in the description down below now I've got a couple quick Trends I'll have Nate back to commentate with me on some of these and um we talked about in the first part about algorithm updates we talked about um Trends and thumbnails we talked about long form and short form um we've been covering in 10 viral video Trends you need to try here's a couple more um the rise of the niche appearence Creator it's like Niche experience Creator try to be creative there this is basically creators that are finding success by combining their unique life experience with specific Niche interests now as a YouTube educator one thing I've noticed and I don't know if you've seen this there's this massive trend on like why people over 40 must start a YouTube channel and Rob the maritim up in Canada has kind of like led the wave as far as I could tell but a lot of others Kevin col's a good friend um he jumped on that you see multiple channels jumping on it but what are we talking about you know in any given Niche you might feel like it's so competitive you know well finding ways to Niche down is a great way to stand out and not only that I think there's also a couple things that we're seeing here this is the over 40 YouTube Boom um it's also this idea of the of the experienced YouTuber um and you're also tapping into a trend of like there's a real Community here that's that's it's resonating with for a long time YouTube is seen as the domain of younger creators so this trend recognizes there's a huge audience of people over 40 who are interested in content created um in this particular Niche so what else could this apply to well you know Andrew uh Bustamante if I'm saying his last name right you know not all of us are excia agents like he is but I mean he is an ex CIA agent he specializes in spy skills so he's taking his experience and then tying it into here's this promise I will teach you the same awesome spy skills I learned in this CIA so you can make more money get better health and live an amazing life on your own terms so this kind of like rise of the niche experience content creator like another example could be if you were like a retired teacher explaining Tech or making Tech simple the experience is retired teachers who have a knack for explaining things clearly the niche is maybe you're targeting older adults who struggle to keep up with technology so you know kind of the tone and the pacing and the storytelling you want to do and then an example could be Tech tips with Mr Jones uh you could offer tutorials using smartphone social media online services and you're taking your experience by the way this is why creaters over 40 50 60 of all ages or maybe gen Z that have spent a couple years in a particular world every the world you've been immersed in if you like shine some light on that and creatively package that people from all around the world want to hear from you learn from you so I think this is an interesting Trend that I'm seeing Nate have you noticed that in any particular areas and I'm curious I bet your algorithm wasn't hit with over 40 which speaks to the fact maybe it was but you can tell me in a second it speaks to the fact that all of our homepages are different everybody's homepage is different everybody's algorithm is different so there's this massive opportunity when you understand how the YouTube algorithm Works to be creating content that resonates with a certain demo right your your algorithm I'm sure there's probably some overlap in the fact that we both like are logged into our think media account so it's probably mixed yeah I I search up think media every day so my algorithm is probably skewed but uh I believe that one example why you should start a YouTube channel over 40 I think it was like someone film making related so like I saw that pop up but it is interesting and I it's so interesting that there's so many opportunities to start a YouTube channel and not many people just beyond you know getting subscribers getting views so those are just different angles right that people can tap into what is people's unique selling points that they've lived their whole life that's one advantage like I started YouTube when I was really young so like I didn't have experience or profis I was just kind of learning as I was going but someone comes and they live their life right they have all these skill sets all these stories that they can tell in their videos so I think that's one great way to just hop on the train and really help influence people I love it I got a couple more here uh and these kind of Stack so identity-driven titles so these are like titles of your video that appeal to a spe a specific identity so look at this um kind of TAPS into the over 40 YouTubers but look at these titles I'm 40 if you're in your 20s watch this I'm 44 if you're in your 20s watch this I'm 57 if you're in your 40s watch this these videos got millions of views which a point to make here too is at the beginning of this entire training we talked about like 10 viral Trends one of the things we talk about in our program in fact Kelly signed up recently congrats for jumping in our VR program in V we talk about this term vfm which is viral for me because if you're typically getting 30 views and then you get 3,000 that would be viral for me right and then you start compounding that success well when you spot a trend like this it's not so much that you're G to get 3.3 million views but it's it's that if you potentially draft on the trend you maybe typically get 300 views and you might get 33,00 which would I know that's not viral by like technical terms but it's definitely viral for me if that's your typical terms so you could kind of call this um you know identity specific titles you're calling out a person and these are not learning as much search based although they kind of tap into search because sometimes people do look for advice and they are 20 or whatever um this's another term for this would be like hyper targeted titles here's another one um if you're still single and want a girl girlfriend watch this video I'm going have to save that video later yes uh so this is kind of again you're typing into an identity a you're you're calling out singles you're calling out a desire and there's putting some mystery in there the way he even added text to the thumbnails powerful the Simplicity we're seeing kind of the stoic anti- YouTuber face thumbnail Trend a lot of combination of things happening here and you could call this also the niche appeal strategy because it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be age it could be relational status it could be uh career status you're just calling people out it's also relatability marketing it captures the core core goal of making viewers feel seen and understood that one hits like that slaps hard if you're like yeah I am single and I want a girlfriend and you know I need to watch that video and so if you're scrolling boom that hits you the YouTube algorithm is like Word of Mouth digitally so it could really get shared Nate how could other I mean how what does this inspire in terms of creativity that creators watching this could apply you know I didn't even really think about this but when you brought up that example it's like I may not have watched a video from them because okay maybe they're not my age demographic but seeing that positioning how they had it suddenly that now attracts a viewer like me so it's like you could attract a whole different Audience by just phrasing it now it's Sol in its position to where I can learn from them I can learn from people who have experienced those things so I think that opens up other opportunities to be like okay maybe how could we target people who want to start a YouTube channel in their 50s and their 60s I saw a YouTube channel this Grandma started Channel and she was in her 90s and she was just uploading day after day multiple times a day she learned how to do it she was do it for fun now she has like 50 something thousand subscribers so those are all super cool um very smart ways to again you're calling out a very specific person and yeah like those those videos attract me even though I wasn't particularly interested in them beforehand and I think it as these continue to stack this is kind of similar but these are also distinct uh another one here would be personalized clickbait so this is kind of acknowledging an attention grabbing element calling out perhaps a specific identity but this might be surprising to some people so I've been seeing videos like this this video will find you right when you need to hear this which is like kind of a crazy title but some of these videos can get hundreds of thousands of millions of views so you're you're relying on pure algorithmic recommendations because you don't even know I don't even know what she's talking about like what do I need to hear and but this video is a 4.8x outlier for her it's getting two views per hour it's spreading in the YouTube algorithm and perhaps probably there is is um I think her photo uh in thumbnail is maybe somebody that resonates with the way she looks maybe that is looking for I'm just speculating here but it's maybe kind of like a girlfriend to connect with talk about advice process issues whatever you're going through now there's another video here right this video will make you see everything in green color again we're talking about this idea on this trend of personalized clickbait like and this idea of saying you like this video will make you see everything in the color green more for the person who's perhaps just opening YouTube Not In Search of answering a specific question or solving a certain problem but just kind of scrolling and looking for something to call out to them this CH Channel rainbow egg is kind of more almost like game gamification type of videos like there's videos that are like quiz kind of quizzes or kind of interactive in a way even though they're not interactive like it's gonna going to trigger something that's kind of entertainment you're just kind of looking for but the way that you're positioning these are baiting The Click by personally calling out a viewer and so uh the next one is the authenticity Revolution this has been said talked about quite a bit I think it's important to notice and this ties all the way back to earlier on the video Nate you were breaking down we're doing split test with three different thumbnails and the most overdesigned with the most text and logos and things on them aren't performing as well as just some of the most M minimalized ones minimalist ones and so for example here's a ve again a uh not an exaggerated face kind of almost a slightly somewhat maybe discouraged or questioning or pensive face title when things just don't work out open loop right there Curiosity and so if you're watching this and you're thinking about you know of course the point with authenticity is not to make it a iick it but it's to do it authentically it's sort of funny that people would try to game authenticity but like titles could be like my biggest insecurity dot dot dot um I failed or things didn't go as planned real talk about insert the topic uh Day in the Life the unedited version responding to your assumptions about me uh what I wish I knew when I was younger so this also perhaps going to help when you have any number of subscribers but if they followed you for a while and they're used to seeing a certain thing from you if I upload a video responding to your assumptions about me it's a great title like I'm ready like what are your assumptions about me tell me in the chat or in the comments I'll make a video or like real talk about and insert maybe taboo topic or something bottom line is we're in the authenticity Revolution and I think the reason people are doing this is this is that pendulum swing away from people maybe feeling burnt out by overpromise is overhype some people call it the uh the era of excess on YouTube and the Mr beastify of YouTube where everything's just so extreme and exaggerated and and truly unrealistic unrelatable and entertaining to a degree Mr BEAST's got quite a bit of smoke around him right now and the whole thing but ultimately vulnerability embracing your imperfections people so much they relate with this type of stuff I've got I'm curious your thoughts n in a second but you know Vanessa salow did uh disappeared for a while and then came back and made a video why I quit I built a seven figure crater business and I quit here's why is kind of that open loop of vulnerability and she got very real in that video I watched uh a good a portion of that video because I was curious and and looking for that more like don't just tell me about your successes tell me about your struggle don't just tell me about the wins or the tactics tell me about the real and the raw the mess marriage is Hard YouTube is hard health challenges what's going on mental health challenges what are things the pressure of all this stuff so we're definitely in that authenticity Revolution um and I think people are tired of fake Perfection right and people are are Tire if it's relatable and so you don't always just have to I I think the cool thing here is alleviate the pressure of having to like always just show success or like how great you are at something you can get a lot of viewers for the fact that you failed at something like doing a cha Challenge and by challenge I mean for 30 days I tried a new routine or I tried to whatever and you didn't succeed but the storytelling of that throw back to Nate's earlier points like a travel vlogger documenting a trip that goes wrong or musici showing behind the scenes of a recording session that was terrible or um you know talking about online hate hate or auty YouTuber talking about struggles with acne and different things people want that real and that raw Nate what do you think about this authenticity Revolution absolutely what I think draws my eye to those thumbnails is like people do like to catch on to human faces so you're immediately like eyes attracted to their eyes then you read the title find out what it is but there is something to be said about that neutral expression this is something that like most skilled actors in Hollywood do is sometimes when you think there's a beautiful performance it's just very minimal because what are you what's the actor doing the person viewing is projecting themselves onto that person and so when you see a title like that you know I quit a seven figure business and that you see their expression but you don't give a lot of details suddenly you now have this curiosity Gap where you're feeding your own projections onto that so you want to click to see if that's true or not so I think that's like little Keys like instead of going a shock face you know all the time try to learn to subdue that again very technical thing but again it's just being more you don't have to be crazy about everything I think that's what we really learned in this vlogging era is like people at the end of the day want to connect with other humans and watch what they do um people want to watch people like them you know I oddly enough like my parents have been watching YouTube on the TV and we'll just watch like people mowing their video like mowing the Lawns right and they do it for free they mow people people Lawns and I'm just like I don't get this at all but there's something to be said about that because the way they um their personality is their certain beliefs that they have their being charitable like all that they're not fantastic content whatsoever you could argue how valuable they are but people watch them and that's that's really interesting so it's great insights okay a couple more this might be my last one but we'll see what we got here so the next one is search optimize driven vlogging and I just did a bit a video with my friend Benji Travis co-author of our book YouTube secrets and we're talking about this trend is taking over vlogging of course some people are saying they're like this trend has always been around and I would say well I mean perhaps but I think what's the big idea here is like sometimes in vlogging people think that the the original Trend was like daily Vlogs and the idea was like it had to be your whole day and thus it started with like you brushing your teeth and ended with you going to bed at night and it sort of you know also was more about the personality where a way to articulate this is it could be about something that people are searching for or a Micro Niche or micro community and there's actual value in it but it's in a vlog style and so we'll link to that video in the description and I'll um if you haven't watched it but Benji's been crushing it on his channel and some of his most viewed videos now we're going to kind of layer strategies is he is driving to he is thinking because of mastering YouTube and the algorithm a lot of times he's planning out his video like on the drive to a location so he's actually thinking though and he's he's going into it not just with the randomness of a vlog but like what's the angle what's the big idea what's the title gonna be what's the thumbnail gonna be and kind of just planning in his head and then he gets there DJI osmo pocket 3 boom hooks in the beginning Vlogs throughout it simple editing pretty basic but if you see this video 5 48,000 views 19 minutes authenticity Revolution because it's not overly edited and polish but minimal edits it's kind of a linear story but it's also does it's not starting it's not a daily Vlog it is a search optimized value driven Vlog right and so what's also interesting is some of his most viewed videos lately have been related to Costco how is Costco different in Japan which this would be two things here hyper Niche domination a very specific Niche like Costco is a niche within a niche it's it's a niche within shopping or retail people love seeing different stores but also micro Community Building Costco enthusiasts are crazy like and people who love micro communities either one you don't watch any Costco videos or two if you do you watch tons of Costco videos that's an interesting thought about YouTube is like when you get into a hyper niche like for me as a Christian and Faith you know person of faith not only is my faith something I take so seriously but I just it's not like I go kind of deep I mean I will I go deep and continuous into that culture because I love studying the Bible I love learning about it listening to different things about it different conversations theology different thing like so like it sort of speaks to the fact that you can like endlessly go deep and why faith and theology is deeper than Costco Costco is close for some people I mean and it's like when you C's always it's a whole fashion culture I mean who here is like Kirkland from head to toe is you know it's a whole it is a subculture Disney is another one like there's micro communities like these subcultures and you can kind of layer on that Vlog style that relational style and I think another key to that is you're doing something that also you would do anyways because Benji is the ultimate food geek loves food loves to cook food wants to talk about food all day and I'm here for it because I like to eat his food uh he makes the best stuff ever go over to his house we live about five minutes apart from each other and like and so he can just kind of freestyle in such a way you definitely know your YouTube channel is about something great if you're freestyling about it can Captivate somebody else's attention for 29 minutes because you're like oh wow I didn't even thought about that oh I didn't even know about the ingredients and oh I hadn't even thought about your perspective so anyways this would be search-based value driven Vlogs and then this idea of like even going deeper the keyword of Costco and the search based around there better than Costco us food chef store so anyways if you haven't watched this video the new vlogging style is taking over for more on that that's in the description down below and it'll probably be the end card at the end of the video um of this one but those are a few more Trends we I think we probably covered more than 10 but we'll do our best to time code in chapter roughly the 10 sections of this video and we could hit a couple questions uh Nate what do you think about kind of this how vlogging is evolved in the way you've seen yeah I was you know having seen like The Inspirations like Casey neist early on like this height of the vlogging era like yeah I watched them a bunch and it's interesting to see you know there's nothing new Under the Sun right like people still want to be they want the solution to their problem right and so what Benji's done really well is like he has found a niche where he can kind of be a Sandbox you know he's not being distracted about these other things but he's really fulfilling on that audience that wants to watch Costco videos and within that box there's a whole world he can be in right so he can talk about these different aspects and finding ways to make those interesting is super interesting one of the key takeaways from that video was the fact that not only he's not trying to be the best Costco video he's trying to be the second best so when you watch the first best his video appears on the side and that's really interesting is YouTube is so vast that you not only are serving those people but the people who want to go deep ER and so I think this just so interesting um I did a video on my channel it was about film making advice I took inspiration when we compiled a uh best YouTube advice for 30 minutes and I'm like I wonder if there's a film making one and to my surprise there wasn't any film making advice compilation that was that long or that ad depth there was a few here and there but there's no video about film making of device of that length and of that stature and I uploaded this is a follow-up to that video and like it's 10,000 views in a a week you know and the first video got 400,000 views and it still shocks me that there's still these other areas of YouTube that are untapped niches you have to find them like it it's it's hard and difficult to sometimes find those things but you're just like one idea away from like making a video that's not on YouTube and that's really cool even in 2024 where people think it's too late there's still all these untapped niches niches within the niches so that would be my encouragement to people is you know if they're want to try something new or they're trying to you know play with things maybe it is taking the vlogging format maybe it is a podcast format but you can bring it to a specific Niche or specific topic yeah you know Ty tying back into earlier when when someone asked what does um repeatable mean when we talk about long form repeatable that's what's kind of cool about this specifically new style of vlogging that Benji's doing he's able to pump out an insane amount of content because of the format because of also it's a whole workflow it's figuring out the right tool DJI osmo pocket 3 you got of think about workflow the idea of having the right tool workflow of I'm gonna film what happens next download the footage edit how do I do the thumbnail make sure to get a picture of the thumbnail and then also though that you could be less interested I mean by the way you just we did another one 10 days ago why toilet paper sold out at Costco Costco makes it in the title and it's like that's gonna be a banger right like it just pops off but that's I mean as we process this Benji has five daughters what are we talking about like so you also think I know people uh are how do I do business uh YouTube with a fulltime job how do I do YouTube and of course he's fulltime and he's got brand deals and they have more momentum and him and Judy like his wife also has a vlog Channel but listen it's not about your resources it's about your resourcefulness and about finding content formats if possible that are sustainable repeatable um and a lot of these factors are actually you don't it's not that you have to start this new style of vlogging there's a lot of different ways you can apply this stuff but a lot of this I mean this is the new style of vlogging this is the authenticity re Revolution this is the Simplicity in thumbnails there 's a lot of common Trends so if you stack what we just talked about in this video you know and you think about which of these Trends can I kind of pull into myons and I really believe there's a ton of views waiting for you on the other side all right I'm gonna share maybe a few final things I wanted to hit one thing just because it is October 15 and today was the day that shorts were supposed to work three minute shorts we did a survey and most people have not tried some people have tried and they did not work as far as three minutes being suggested in the short Shelf but Cameron caught that Creator Lee aison said you can upload them right now but they won't appear as a short until later this week so YouTube appears to not be ready yet that's from Creator liaison who said that so if you're uploading three minutes shorts today trying to hop on that Trend because that's a brand new uh time limit increase that YouTube has updated it looks like later this week they will start making it to the shorts shelf and so for people one ing um yes Michael they're just not working yet but if you upload them now maybe they'll just click over at the end of the week and who knows maybe we have a viral short because YouTube's testing out the new length Nate any final thoughts on the trends today I want to hit one or two more questions myself and then I we'll land the plane but uh yeah give us your takeaway for those that want more views want to grow their channels um yeah I think if my takeaway what I would start implementing today is yeah just authentic thumb Nails uh because I think it's easy for a beginner right instead of worrying how to try to craft a thumbnail just really understand what the viewer is wanting and take a simple like if you're doing a a food cooking show just show a picture of the dish don't show this crazy you know everything else just be really authentic and I think it's an easy way to go about it maybe a little bit of text here and there but um and then find a way for your thumbnail to be different right I think that's why we're seeing this pendulum is is because the authentic is standing out right and it may not stand out forever but I don't see that ever going out of phase either because it's been around for so long and it's just now kind of people like that but that would be my my key takeaway is just learning to be a little bit more authentic with the thumbnail because I think that's going to get people to be better like more relatable and we'll actually click and watch your video you know I I'm really glad you brought that up and and you brought this up and Kyle was telling me about how you were talking about this I think that we could just go a little bit deeper exactly what Nate means if we go into Cana here I think a trend that can happen is um what people would maybe do in the past is uh let me adjust the image and auto adjust and get my little brightness on my photo so here's a photo that I took right in my office here holding a camera um put the timer on shot a thumbnail now what people would do is they'd go background remover and in the past they would then have this cutout image use something like canva Photoshop and whatever and then have this like designed looking thumbnail and I think if what you're talking about though is you're saying that um really the authentic thumbnail could be like leave the The Reel in there so I'm I don't shouldn't have changed the image up but let me let me change it up here I'll go back to the first one let me go to my new my hands open one I have that one here okay so instead of just cutting you out and then having the smoke and the black background or whatever the big idea could be that you simply actually leave the background right and so if we go edit and we go adjust auto adjust and then we go copy paste and I'm going to copy paste the image twice so that the background is still there and then what I might do because you could just leave the image as it is but what I might do here just for my own edits is take the background and then make the brightness a little bit less uh maybe kind of pull the highlights down and perhaps even take something like um a an element and and maybe make a a a could maybe make this like a yellow and then take the opacity of it and bring down that transparency and and you might what do you think even that might be too much I'm going to go a lot darker than that but maybe I just want to give a little bit of tint to the background so now I'm still in my real office but to your point like you also could head over to dolly or something and give yourself an AI background uh and there's something about as like Dave Mae uh would talk about that it's powerful to have um you know the same clothes and maybe the real office that you're in so if it's a fake background but if you were to say um you know simple home office background you also could bottom line articulate what you kind of mean here because I think yeah yeah I think we can get so caught up and we told to make our thumbnails the importance of the thumbnail people now know that which is great but we I feel like sometimes you if you don't have a lot of professional skill like you end up going down this road that you know it's maybe it's making your thumbnail actually worse so what for me at least my like my skill set it's like I could actually just take a good photo and then not have to worry about designing anything I just like okay make sure you open your window get good lighting but I think even this right like this is a little bit more authentic right it's less of that design background um I'm not saying the it's worse you know you don't it's not like it a s that you're doing it this way you know but I think I would try that like if you are working on designing using canva like I use canva but if you could just experiment and take a step away and like okay let me just take a photo of in my room and do an AB test just see what does better because maybe I'm wrong I could be wrong but if we're looking at the data showing us that what you're doing here is just taking what's real and then just tweaking it so that way your eye actually pops on screen adding some contrast cleaning up your background a little bit totally fine but um I think those are just ways to just leverage that authenticity definitely wear the same clothes in your video I think that's going to help um drive that authenticity when people watch your video Dave altiser was talking about he did a video where he was um showing off like an iPhone tutorial and the first image the thumbnail was the first image of the video so when you clicked on the thumbnail boom ready you're confirmed that you're watching the video you set out to see versus cutting away to a talking head that maybe is not that immediate payoff so those are little tweaks you can make um and I like what you're doing here just kind of taking it as if you were in a studio cleaning up a little bit um it just feels a little bit more I guess authentic is what we're seeing here yeah and right now if you're curious as we land the plane um using Dolly and just kind of like throwing in some AI images maybe getting the actual dimensions right and all those kinds of things could be of course important uh but uh so that because even the perspective and like what exactly is happening here but we're living in an interesting era and I guess even yeah the light's kind of in a weird spot but like you know sort of actually I guess probably you might have like field of view and once you get it underneath yeah I I compared to just design and I I I loved your point because we were doing our YouTube challenge and I was making a thumbnail in like under two minutes or under three minutes and I think the the modern point was that was just to get people started but what people are so used to seeing now is like everyone's seeing the same canva template so it's and and on this like designed background with the same red with the you know little whatever like we see some of the things so it's how could we be different and if possible if you could take photos in your own environment or um different things and still I do think the tweaks to it whether dimming the background you know I put a drop shadow on myself here some colors some different things you can certainly still do some things to make the pop but yet you're still in that authentic environment we're tapping into that authenticity uh Revolution hey was that uh helpful little tutorial Nate good way to land the plane did made the plane take off again it was like I was like well let's open up canva and Ai and just dive into some stuff but I appreciate you thanks for um adding so much value today and if you got value from Nate's tips smash the like button um also today's stream was brought to you by vid iq.com think if you want to grab a $1 trial of the 30-day version of um 30 days of IQ boost uh I am curious what kind of niches are you in here and do you have any questions as we land the plane today but like what's your YouTube channel Niche um why I'm asking you that as well I would love to get as many questions as we can but we do have to land the plane pretty soon and so I did a new Post in the community tab it looks like this um and on this post it's a carousel I just ask for your questions and I'm also asking you to upvote questions so if you head over to that post on the think media Community Tab and post your question upvote any of the questions you like I'm going to do a new batch of the whatever we're calling this repeatable long form Series where I kind of take one question and then do a deep dive on it so that's another place you could post that but uh let's see um my Niche is a bit of travel and lifestyle in Ecuador is GM a here so one of the Cool Tools on vid IQ is called the generate tool and if you were to say eador um day in the life if you have a general idea and you use the generate tool of vid IQ let's check out the tips here and this is using vid IQ so first thing as I just typed in a general idea it's actually going to give us a couple of the top related keywords now some people would say this doesn't matter and they're wrong it's not that it matters because those tags are going to help you it matters in helping you position your video to know what kind of Search terms or language or words so you really dial in your video idea properly okay so ultimately then it comes up with a title Ecuador in 24 hours a day in the life of an Ecuadorian which is amazing because now you know okay cool what could I get accomplished in 24 hours you reverse engineer the video if you click over here you could make it longer shorter add excitement change the tone maybe make it a little more witty and you could spin the title until you get it correct now this is one of the biggest principles we always talk about too we research before we press record we um we want to know our title even before we film the video if possible so 24 hours in Ecuador a day in the life living like an Ecuadorian for 24 hours Okay cool so you figure out your idea and then you also see some different tags which by the way even if they don't matter that much because again the tags themselves aren't going to move the needle you could just copy paste these tags and move them over to your video to reinforce the uh YouTube Understanding what your video is about and then it's giving us some thumbnail inspiration now it's not that you're going to use these thumbnails but it's G giving you the inspiration for the shot composition of what your thumbnail could be these are all great they're vibrant shot composition okay let me let me shoot a couple maybe and let me pre-plan my thumbnails so they pop in most cases no text in this case only 24 hours you could choose a different font uh maybe get rid of the only to say 24 hours and then it tees you up with a hook and even an outline with the hook introduction presentation of problem and challenge then the storytelling stuff that Nate was talking about earlier vid IQ will do that heavy lifting for you it'll walk you through be thinking about introducing a problem and Challenge and then be thinking about the exploration and development of that and then be thinking about the climax and the key moment and what's the conclusion in the summary and you could generate even a greater skip if script if you want this is just one Tool It's called The generate tool and um it's part of a suite of tools that vid IQ has that you can check out if you want so anyways shout out to vid IQ for uh being one of our partners at think media vid iq.com think if you want to try out a 30-day trial of vid iq's boost plan and try the generate tool try the outliers tool we talked about earlier Link in the description um and it's just $1 if you want to cancel before the deadline then um I don't know where else you're going to spend a dollar but that's probably the best use I mean of all things you could spend a dollar on this month you know pitch me in the comments if you think there's another way there's not a lot of ways you could spend a dollar these days so it's pretty cool um all right if you have any questions uh let's see Kelly says vid IQ is worth it it grades your titles and thumbnails which is very helpful I agree uh let's see made by uh pan said uh vid IQ is really useful I agree appreciate it and um yeah crazy value for a dollar good call it's not a lot of things you could get for a dollar there is one of my favorite instagrammers right now though his name's Damon darling and he and he and he talks about you got a dollar and then they say no and he goes oh here you go everyone in America should have a darn dollar look him up man that's that's going to be an Instagram Rabbit Hole to travel down for a while um and with that uh I think that uh it was a pretty good stream we're an hour and 33 minutes in check the replay out because we covered a lot of stuff we T covered at least 10 Trends probably really more than that and if you're just joining um the time codes and chapters

no one's going to click on our video if you don't write a good title what if the only reason that people weren't watching your videos was that you were choosing bad titles the best titles create an emotional response that cause you to click the three I'm calling them click-worthy emotions are curiosity fear and desire and it's usually curiosity plus fear or curiosity plus desire that's Jake Thomas he's the writer of a popular newsletter called Creator hooks which is dedicated to helping you write better YouTube titles based in human psychology what I love about Jake's approach is that he's very data driven I've got a database of 408 titles right now 61 of them have curiosity 46 have desired 40 have fear or negativity so in this episode you'll learn how to research your own titles how to leverage human psychology to get more views some of the most successful Frameworks Jake has found and why curiosity is the most impactful emotion that you can tap into but now let's talk with Jake [Music] [Music] a lot of people when they're you know just starting their trying to do some research look at other channels that are kind of like them but I feel like a lot of people are also sucked into the Trap of saying I'm just gonna model off of the biggest names in the business I'm gonna go and see what Mr Beast is doing I'm gonna go see what Emma Chamberlain is doing I'm gonna go just like see what these people are doing really well and model after that because if it's working for them it seems like it should work for me is that the right way to think about it and if not how should I be doing research across different channels for my titles I don't think it's the the right way to do it so if I got Emma Chamberlain's titles up right now cooking Ugg season my childhood bedroom it will be okay so like she has a title that's literally just cooking and that's all it is and unless you're Emma Chamberlain that is not going to work for you unless you have let's see 11.8 million subscribers it will not work because it's just just like a plain statement there's no emotion there so no I think that you should uh model people a couple steps ahead of you you know like if you're just getting started maybe you want to model people in the you know 50 000 or you know five thousand fifty thousand five hundred thousand someone who's not like a just total celebrity and just has like you know so much influence outside of YouTube that no matter what like they're going to be successful so definitely don't look at the people way high up try to find people a couple steps ahead of you see what they're doing and I think that's like just definitely the best thing that you can do especially getting started if you don't know anything like even like you know how do I write my intros how do I do my lighting how long should my video be when you're getting started all the answers are there but just looking at what is working for your competitors and then you know as you kind of do that you'll slowly get like kind of your own feel and your own Vibe but definitely the best way to do it is to kind of copy first like people do like copy work like you know you hand write old sales letters to learn how to become a good copywriter people have been recommending that for like I don't know 70 years or something like that and it's been working for them don't try to be like super original don't try to model an mha Berlin no offense in her but it's probably not going to work for you try to find people a couple steps ahead of you and do what they're doing I think that's good advice for creators of any kind actually because it's it's really easy to go and and look after these bigger channels or creators or Platforms in general and think well if they're doing it it must work but there have been some times in my life where I've looked at uh landing pages home pages sales pages of big websites and said oh this must be what works and then copied that and then within like days or weeks they change it because it probably wasn't performing so like not only should you look at people who are closer to you but maybe you should even reach out to people and ask if there's not like clear public data you should reach out and say hey I'm just curious how this is going for you maybe not the first question in their Twitter DMS but you know get get to it because I think that's a really smart advice sometimes people are succeeding in spite of not doing things in the most effective way yeah definitely but also like if you're just getting started like just just do it like don't let analysis paralysis you know kind of stop you from taking action like all right cool like when I first launched my um my newsletter I had like a really really ugly newsletter title or sorry newsletter um like landing page it was terrible like my conversion rate was bad when I got started and then I kind of asked around and I started looking at others and I eventually figured it out but uh just like copying like the first landing page that I saw like worked for me to get up and just get moving and another thing that someone told me this a couple of weeks ago and it was you can't sit your parked car and I was like oh this is great like um yeah when you're when you're just getting started like just move yes and then figure it out yes how did you get to YouTube titles of all things I've been in like Marketing in general for like 10 years or so I was uh I worked at a Facebook Ad Agency and it was it was terrible and our my favorite client they were like Hey we're hiring a writer so I was able to like jump on board with them and I hadn't had I didn't have any YouTube experience but he's like hey you're going to be our editor-in-chief our media buyer and our YouTube channel manager and I was like oh this is great like no no YouTube experience and my boss was like a really really good copywriter and he beat into my head the importance of writing titles he's like because we were a fishing channel and we had like spent a lot of money to send our fishing coaches out uh you know like kayaking or out on the boat spending all day like making content so we would we spent a lot of money on our content and he's like if you don't write a good title then we wasted all of this money you know filming creating uh you know fishing catching all these fish and also uh if you don't write a good title then we're not going to get any of the benefits like no one's going to click on our video if you don't write a good title so like the pressure was on that sounds like a lot of pressure yeah it was and the only problem was he was great and like my favorite Boss by far but he wasn't like a he didn't know how to teach me how to write good YouTube titles so it's kind of on my own uh I almost got fired because I was so bad at first oh no and like I actually talked to him about it like a couple years after and I was like yeah like when I got started it wasn't the best he's like yeah it wasn't it wasn't the best we weren't sure if we were gonna keep you you're telling me it wasn't the best but but somehow I kind of figured it out and the thing that like the thing that made it click for me was we were a fishing channel and my boss went on a podcast of a hunting channel and they did a podcast that was uh newbie hunting gear and the guy said like that newbie hunting gear podcast crushed it for them so my boss came back he's like hey we're gonna do a podcast about newbie fishing gear so I was like all right cool like let's do it turns out that was our best podcast like for the month like for the past few months that's when it kind of clicked it was like okay I don't need to be original I need to just like find something that works and then model that and it's not like copying right like you know there was newbie hunting gear where newbie fishing gear like we're just following that same model and then once I realized that I got on a roll and like I finally understood like okay like it's not all up to me to be like totally original and write these great titles and then we find it like turn it around I didn't get fired our Channel like 3x our Revenue Forex so everything was everything was good after that and then once like kind of I figured out all right cool like this is how you write a good YouTube title like from a beginner then I slowly figured it out and I was like oh cool like here are the patterns that all of these successful YouTube titles have now we can kind of get out of that box of like just modeling to like actually coming up with original content how did you go about finding these templates of breakout sort of successes because it seems like YouTube has just an endless amount of content so how did you boil that ocean start to way fine to specific title structures that worked for you just spending a lot of time studying YouTube titles you know going to a bunch of different channels and YouTube makes it super easy because you can see the publish date you can see how many views they have and just like just spending hours every single week for over a year or you know almost two years now just like scanning like okay like you know this video is published uh you know a couple weeks ago but it has like a hundred thousand views all of the other videos published around it have like ten thousand okay there's something here and then you take note of that and you do that you know a thousand times a couple hundred times then boom you start to see you start to see pattern so it's really just putting in time and studying and taking really deliberate notes how much were you looking at the same industry and channels in that same industry versus something that might be like a little bit orthogonal to it like it's kind of touching that industry versus something that's completely out of that industry but doing well really just like trying to get a a broad spectrum of Industries like the craziest thing is when I see today I was looking at it was like a like a hair Channel and one of their best videos like I was like oh I've seen like this exact model work on like all sorts of other different channels yeah so just really just trying to get a really broad spectrum of titles and then you know putting all those notes together and like seeing the patterns and it's like oh it really doesn't matter like what industry this is in like you know regrets always work well or something like that when you're doing this are you putting this into a spreadsheet is it structured is it just gut feel and if it is structured how does that look it is a little structured that's just in Google Sheets so I've just got like the title The publish date and like the the URL and it just started as that and then as I started to recognize patterns it's like okay like let me know this one had fear Okay and like then I would go through all the other you know 100 titles that I had before all right this one had fear this one had fear this one had fear cool okay like you know 30 of these titles have fear and then I would start to notice like new patterns so it was just it was real it's really simple just in Google Sheets and there's it's nothing fancy just as I you know as I kept learning new things like all right let me jot it down let me see if I can organize this a little better and just so people are on the same page you're not talking about the literal word fear you're talking about the emotional pull of fear correct yes correct okay talk more about that because I I've heard you talk about some of these emotions that you think underlie a good title is it fair to say that emotions are what make a good title yeah so a couple a couple weeks ago I was looking at this guy's Channel and he was struggling with his YouTube channel and he's like hey man like I'm putting in all the work I'm like you know my uh my thumbnails are getting better my storytelling my editing is getting better like what why am I not growing and I looked at his titles and they were all bland statements like there was no emotion and the three I'm calling them click-worthy emotions are curiosity fear and desire and it's usually curiosity plus fear or curiosity plus desire and that's like the simplest way to explain what makes a good title is just curiosity for your desire you know and there's a bunch of different nuances you know below that but that's like the just the high level version of what makes a good title I like that you're focusing on kind of emotional terms and ideas as opposed to strictly like templated language because I'm sure there are Trends within language that work pretty well but I would imagine they they probably get stale also so when you're looking at curiosity fear and desire and saying I want to tie capacity to fear or curiosity to desire how often are you seeing trends like go in and out so far I haven't and it's been a couple years so I haven't seen any like big trends go in and out yet like the main Trend that I that comes to mind is like a like a 20 like 14 BuzzFeed article like 36 new podcast mics you'll never guess number 17 or something like that doctors hate this guy yeah yeah and like but it's still using like there's curiosity there's like a little bit of fear there you know it's a list and that those things still work well it's just like how you apply them people kind of cut on and now it's like all right that's too clickbaity for me but I mean it's the still the same principles were working back then and they're still working now and I've read a lot of like you know copywriting books from like the 30s 1930s 1950s 60s and they're all just saying the same thing like it's it's all psychology that gets people's attention and gets people to click do you have any examples of titles that are pulling on curiosity and fear or curiosity and desire that people can kind of start to map this in their mind to what this looks like just kind of to get like super nerdy here I've got a database of 408 titles right now and 61 of them have curiosity 46 have desire and 40 percent have fear or negativity so wow a couple of examples here seven things plant experts do that you probably don't that kind of opens up a loop there it's like oh like in that opening a loop is a great way to build curiosity you're starting a story but not finishing it when you read that title like oh what are these plant experts doing that I'm not so there's a lot of curiosity yes yes it's there's fomo there you know which is like you know fear of missing out so there's fear there's also curiosity like what are these things that these plant experts are doing what about desire give me a desire example how a pro YouTuber actually makes thumbnails like just the word actually is like really simple you kind of feel like you're getting in on a secret there like how they actually do that it's like okay like I thought that I knew how they make titles or how they make thumbnails but like here's how they really do it here's how they actually do it kind of feels like they're you know like kind of giving you Insider information or you know you know pulling back the curtain there so you feel like you're getting in on a secret so that's one way to build curiosity but you're also speaking to a desire so you know if you want to make better thumbnails it's like oh here's how the pros do it so there's Authority there as well so you have desire you have curiosity by revealing a secret and then you also are you're talking about Authority so like that has like some instant trust and credibility credibility there because this is how the pros do it when you are writing titles for yourself or for other people knowing what you know what is your starting point for making a title it starts with the idea it's like putting lipstick on a pig like if you have a bad idea it doesn't matter how clever you are at like word smithing good titles or or how you know good of a graphic designer or good of a thumbnail maker are if you have a bad idea then you're just wasting your time so it always starts with the idea and that's that's the most important thing and then just coming from there it's like you know what angle do we want to kind of attack this topic and that kind of depends on what have we done before and like a lot of people say the secret to like creating content is just saying the same thing 100 different ways because there are like there are some ideas or some topics that just work well no matter what so you just got to kind of you know ride that wave while you can but the secret is like just saying that a bunch of different ways so for an example like let's say we're a finance Channel talking about like picking stocks so you could say like how to pick stocks as a beginner right so you know talk to beginners and like be calling out beginners is a great way to get people to click because you're calling out a specific audience not only is that audience like like very specific like if you're a beginner like if you see like kind of your name right there in the title it's like oh shoot this this video is for me but also they're like the hungriest right you know because they're beginners they want to learn and they're the most insecure so uh right now I'm learning how to play the piano I'm learning on YouTube and I went through a through a YouTube um Channel teaching piano and I was watching like all their videos on how to play the piano after like two hours I'm laying in bed and I'm like wait what did I just do and I watched all of the videos that had the word beginner in them and that was because I was like insecure about my piano playing skills like rightfully so because I was a beginner and I felt that all the other videos were they were too advanced for me like oh you know this song or this exercise is too advanced like give me something for me give me something specific for beginners so I was insecure like I felt that like like this video was just for me so that that's a you know one great uh way to get people to click is to just call out beginners right there in your title so if you're you know making your stocks video how to pick stocks for beginners you could talk about like you know the best uh the best stocks in uh you know November 2022 timeliness is another good one um you could talk about like regrets like I regret picking these stocks last year people love regrets ah those are just like a couple different ways of saying the same thing over and over again and I'm calling them click triggers there's like 31 and we've already talked about a lot of them like you know revealing a secret opening a loop regrets um it's just like fear desire all that stuff and those are just like kind of moves that like moves that you can make or like pitches that you have like in Your Arsenal like you know how am I gonna if you're a pitcher you're looking at Aaron judge and like how am I going to get him out first off there and judge it's not gonna happen but uh but you're like all right you know what am I gonna throw him like you know the sink or the slider the fastball change up you know and that's how I kind of look at these click triggers it's like all right what's the best way uh to get people to click and get people excited about this topic the we had to use visual b-roll there so that people watching this you know like sports Aaron judge pitcher what what does mean uh I'm also like thinking to myself we've got to find some way to get video of Jake playing piano now I love it after a quick break Jake and I get even more in the weeds of how he researches and chooses titles and later we dive into some of the theories that Jake has that he's still collecting data about so stick around we'll be right back if you like creative elements you would love my Weekly Newsletter Creator science I send it every Sunday and it breaks down everything I'm learning about how to be a professional Creator it expands on the things we talk about here on this show and it even goes behind the scenes of my own business and shows you what I'm doing what I'm experimenting with in my own Journey if you're serious about this I think it is a must read more than 14 000 creators already subscribe so if you are not already subscribed go to creatorscience.com And subscribe for free and I'll talk to you on Sunday welcome back to my conversation with Jake Thomas before the break Jake and I were talking about his research process and something I shared with Jake is that one of my favorite ways to do my own research is to pay close attention to the things that drive me to take action if I click something why did I click that if I buy something why did I buy that I have a I actually have like an Evernote document from like 20 like 16 or 2015 or something and that was like my first like uh obsession with titles and like what gets people to click because I was that was like when I was really like learning everything I didn't know anything I was just kind of starting to try to make it online then I was like oh wow like I'm you know um this this article really caught my eye so I would put in the document and I was like oh this one caught my eye too I put in the document and I noticed after like the first five they were all fear-based I was like all right is this just is this just me like what what is going on here fear is working very well on me I hate that about our psychology it's such a bummer but it's true but like the idea of titling all of my videos to like prey on people's fears and insecurities it's just like so antithetical to what I want to do but like I get it I get that it works we have this little bit of tension with with our Channel where we know like hey you know what YouTube audiences they love to talk about money they love to hear about money they love to look at money that historically has never been what the show is about but like I get it so we play the game a little bit but I'm I'm constantly fighting against like what how much am I youtubing this show and going too far yeah are you like are you just gonna try to find a balance there are you gonna like stick to your guns and like just know that it's a it's a really good question because I and I'd love to hear your take on this I feel like we're already playing the game on hard mode a little bit because long form interviews not the typical content that does well on YouTube now it seems like there might be some Tailwinds there where YouTube is saying like we actually want to encourage this type of content and behavior I feel like we're entering an already hard game and playing it from like the hardest perspective and titling comes up sometimes because it feels like we should lean into the name recognition of the guest in the title because that's probably our best angle and then Conor does a really good job of finding some of these these uh trends that you've talked about like we've used the secret a couple of times in the title but it's hard because that video the payoff to that video is one part of the interview and there's all kinds of stuff that goes into the interview so if it was just me and I wasn't trying to play any type of game it would just be like episode whatever Jake Thomas and that would be it but I don't think that would work so well what do you think I agree I mean there's that that balance and like I'm doing it a lot so I have a dog YouTube channel I got a dog email list and a dog blog and then also I'm on Twitter and then I do some other stuff for clients and but on Twitter like one of my best uh threads or like 99 of people suck at writing YouTube titles and it's just like just totally bashing fear like all negativity there it's like every time I do that like those types of titles just work well and I don't know I go I go back and forth one way to I'm just going to kind of deflect this question that is not what you do one one way to uh to like make like turn that uh ickiness dial down is to say like you will regret uh you know not titling your YouTube your YouTube videos like this right that's like you're turning that way up like that just feels icky like you will regret it doesn't feel good but if you say I regret titling my YouTube video like this oh it's an experience thing it's not like an attack it's like yeah this is my experience yes yes sharing your story you know my biggest mistake I regret so like if you want to use like the the like the really effective emotion of fear but you want to turn the ickiness dial down share your own story or like he did this not like just taking out the word you you know that's the probably the best way to do it but for me it kind of depends on like how is my business going like if I'm growing it's like all right cool yeah I'm gonna be a little bit less aggressive right now like I don't really I don't need this thread to do super well like I just want to kind of serve my audience if I'm like dang the newsletter is not really growing right now I really need to step up growth then I'll be like okay let me let me play this game not on hard mode let me let me do what I know works even though I may feel not the best about it but still you know still not like being like totally fear-mongery and clickbaity I mean I don't know if that's a good answer but that's how I think about it a little bit when you have like competing ideas for a title let's say that the idea itself is good you feel good about it and you're looking at different types of titles that all are playing on curiosity and fear or curiosity and desire how do you end up making a decision which one to go with one thing that I'll do is I will like just search my title and try to see has this uh has this done well in the past so like we let's say that you're in kind of an obscure Niche like let's say you were doing you know like steam mops uh I don't know if steam mops are popular maybe they are so if you were like uh you know my biggest regret uh you know buying my first steam mop or if you wanted to say like I'm like all right cool I could do that or I could say like you know five mistakes to buying your Steam Mop you could write that same title but like with vacuums or something like a little bit broader and you because I'm just looking for that Trend like has this has this trend for something similar in this you know similar to this has it worked before like YouTube will tell you YouTube is great like like I said they have the view date and the or the published date and the view counts so they'll let you know yes this has worked or no this has not worked let's say that I wanted to lean into this strategy and as an interviewer who's already pegged the guest name is important for the title which would you agree should I be using that as one of the most important parts of the title it depends for me uh no like I'm I don't think my name I don't I'm not like a heavy hitter but if you're interviewing garyvee absolutely you know if you were titling this interview you might do something like you know the best way to write YouTube titles or five YouTube title mistakes everybody you're probably making or something like that something a little bit spicier than that my name isn't care doesn't carry a ton of weight so I would either give my I'd either like skip it or you could say like you know uh the biggest YouTube title nerd or something give me a label I don't think it would be like the best thing to do yes you could and uh one one of these days maybe my name will carry weight but um but I would give myself a label or uh you know just you know talk about a benefit or something or a mistake or fear or something like that if I were to lean into Justin Welsh let's say he has a growing profile more people are searching for his name if before we release our episode we search Justin Welsh and we look at the first five videos that are listed there how closely should we model the actual titles of videos that are doing well versus use that to say let's do something completely different it depends so probably like with with Justin like he's blowing up but also he's like not that big like you know this isn't like a this isn't a super big space right so if you model it really closely that's kind of that's teetering on the the um the okay this is like kind of sort of copying uh but not really so you know in the case of like because like this is a small smaller industry I don't know you you might want to figure out what are the elements like that are making people click like the creative elements oh what is yes what are these creative title elements that are making people click like do do all of them have like you know two million dollars in them or do all of them have you know solopreneur in them or you know other things that you might include and it's like okay I definitely need to include the number like you know how the solopreneur made what you know however many millions of dollars like that's it like that's a great hook and I'm gonna do it but if they're all different then it's like okay cool like this is this is kind of a free-for-all uh there's no real themes here I'm just just gonna you know pick you know the most interesting thing about the video or the most interesting thing about Justin and go for it how do you think about brevity because as you're listing off some of these they they seem pretty concise and I could easily reason my way into saying let me just add like three tags because we talk about three different categories in this podcast so what if I just say here are the five mistakes people make here are the 10 best YouTube titles and also here is why you need to be thinking about curiosity desire and fear and put that all into a title yeah I think there's a I'm gonna spit like some cliche things at you like if you confuse you loose if there's like so many different uh like it's kind of like keyword stuffing almost but like not really keyword stuffing just a bunch of different things if you confuse you lose so if your keyword is like really long then you know it's just not easy to instantly understand also uh no Focus no audience so you know the more commas and the more ands you put in your title like the longer it is it's just not going to have a focus it's not gonna have like as much power to like it's not really gonna pack a punch and people like oh I really I really want to watch this I'm doing a bunch of a b tests on whether or not the word and or like having multiple subjects affects a uh affects a title so I will have some more data for you there but I'm I'm just I'm trying not to use the word and I'm trying to be brief I'm trying to focus on just one thing just like the single most powerful thing you know this is YouTube and people are scrolling and you know you want someone to like instantly latch on to that one thing if there are three different subjects there then it's going to take people a long time to read it a lot a lot longer of a time to read it than if it was just one subject it's going to take people longer to understand it and like that's too much work for their brain if they're just scrolling so the likelihood is greater that they're just going to um that they're just going to just kind of scroll on by here's some data for you so my email subject lines so I run the Creator hooks newsletter and it used to be Creator Hooks and then I would list out three things like you know biggest YouTube fears YouTube mistakes and hitting a million subscribers so it was always that Creator hooks colon three things and then I switched to only having like only kind of modeling one of the titles from Creator hooks it was a little shorter it was more concise it was one idea and my email opened rate open rate went from about 35 to about 50 percent oh wow so it was like 35 to 40 and now it's like 45 to 55. so having you know just one thing has helped I love this data this is so good one thing that you haven't mentioned is thumbnails or description so I guess that's two things and I think we both agree that having a good con good idea with good content is prerequisite let's say that that like that's what you should focus on is having a good idea have good content because none of this probably matters if not how do you weigh titles versus thumbnails do descriptions matter at all we are are getting a little bit out of my expertise I'm mostly just nerding out on titles as far as descriptions go I don't think they matter that much I mean YouTube is smart and they have a lot of things that they're looking at you know tags and descriptions I think are less important than YouTube like actually seeing what is in the video because they do that and like all right this is what the video is about like it doesn't maybe it doesn't matter as much as like this the description so they know what your video is about thumbnails this is my personal opinion but I think that thumbnails are more important in entertainment and titles are more important in education um I I think because you can show a story much better in entertainment so yeah you need to have a killer thumbnail in education it's not as it's not as important I think it's still obviously very important but I think that you need to have a great idea and convey that idea mostly in the title I think the the title is kind of the best way to plainly convey that idea spicy takes I like this I like the spicy takes when you are playing around titles and I know you test titles you do a b testing on these things how frequently do you do that like when is too early to say and this isn't performing the way I thought time for me to go back to the drawing board and try another title so I usually wait I wait it out because I am fairly confident in my titles for the most part also I've seen like some of my videos have blown up like after like a day and a half like just kind of randomly like you know here's my graph and all of a sudden I'm like oh I didn't do anything and then all of a sudden it like kind of usually drops off too but I didn't I didn't make any changes to make it blow up I didn't make any changes to make it slow down but what I always do with my a b testing is I wait five days days because if you test too early YouTube is you know showing your video to your subscribers so people are way more likely to click on the first day and then it kind of goes down and with a B testing I use tubebuddy or thumbnailtest.com those are two different tools I think the only way to a B test right now is switching the title or or the or the thumbnail every 24 hours knowing that it switches every 24 hours if you launch your test on the first day your first day is almost always going to be the highest CTR because the YouTube is going to show it to like your most loyal followers and people who are clicking on the first day are usually your most loyal followers so just kind of by default you're way more likely to have a higher CTA on day one than day two so that's just kind of gonna give you bad data right there so I wait at least five days for things to kind of like settle down and it's like all right cool now I'm going to test this and I know that this is going to give me the most accurate data because that kind of wild crazy almost like inflated data in the first couple days is gone so I wait a couple days I test it out I know a lot of people test it out like within an hour or two hours and yeah yeah and I don't know how I feel about that I usually don't do that I mean if it's if your video is like really flopping like yeah maybe maybe go with your plan B I just like to get real data I love studying the A B test data and it's not perfect but if you use it as like a compass say okay these Trends work for me these Trends don't work for me like not that okay this was 10.2 percent higher like you know this is this is the one it's more like okay cool like in 10 different tests like this theme is working way more than this theme like I'm gonna use this theme more going forward so yeah so just wait it out um or sorry that's what I do I wait it out I know a lot of people don't do that and then I try to get real data and I try to just kind of learn from that I haven't used tubebuddy or any of these tools paint me a visual picture of what that looks like to use a tool like that to test these things with uh tubebuddy um you can upload you know one alternate you know so you're a b testing you can't a b c d test so then you'll upload you know a thumbnail or a title you can do both I would definitely recommend only doing one at a time unless you were testing like a whole new idea then you might want to have a new set of title and thumbnail it's like super simple we just upload it uh you know click like run test and then you'll set like how many days you want to test I usually test for seven days per title so on tubebuddy if you're only testing you know another alternate then it'll be 14 days come back 14 days later and then you can see the results like it'll show you the click-through rate I'm going to show you the Impressions you know clicks for impression also show you the watch time it'll help you know like you know sometimes you might have a much higher click-through rate but maybe your average view duration went down and it's like okay maybe this video is clickbait or this title was like two clickbaity like people just clicked it and went away right away what I've often seen and maybe like this is just me like reading bad data and making like making assumptions there I've often seen a higher click-through rate correlate with um a higher watch time I think that's because people are just if you write a more interesting title people are more excited to uh watch it so like yeah more people are clicking on it because they're more excited to watch it so they're gonna give it a longer shot than like maybe people like people were kind of doubting it like ah I'll click it and like you know they're just going into it like I probably don't want to watch this video and you're just gonna confirm their beliefs right away when you don't have like some crazy insane intro so when you're making an A B test in tubebuddy they aren't able to do that in real time across titles are they can they serve like different audiences different titles and give you a real-time tests across okay so it's like a global change for a period of time yes yes I uh I don't love that they they change it every 24 hours and then they look at the data for that time period and they kind of aggregate that data so yeah I don't love it it's not perfect and that's why I say use it as a compass to say okay like this is a trend not like all right this is like this is the law when we come back Jake and I talk about chapter titles in YouTube and some of the theories that he's still testing so stick with me we'll be right back hey thanks for watching creative elements this is a brand new channel here on YouTube so liking the videos leaving comments subscribing the channel sharing the show all that support goes a long long way right now it is all seen it is all appreciated and even though this is a brand new channel here on YouTube I've actually been conducting interviews with creators just like this for more than two years there are more than 100 interviews that you can go back and listen to with creators like Seth Godin James Clear Cody Sanchez Tori Dunlap even YouTubers like Ali abdall Matt diovella Roberto Blake and Marie Poulin I've actually created some playlists for you to help get you started to dive into some of the best episodes that we've done to date just go to creative elements.fm playlists the link is also Down Below in the description but you can filter episodes there by platform or medium if you want to just look at episodes with YouTubers or just episodes with instagramers you can do that with those starter playlists at creative elements.fm playlist and again link is down below in the description hey welcome back you may have noticed that in our videos we have chapter markers all throughout the video and the reason we do that is I've seen those chapter markers get pulled into Google search results so I asked Jake how he thinks about chapter markers and if he makes good use of them I don't use them for my uh for My Dog Channel and maybe this is me like like trying to be like old school maybe too direct marketer but like I want people to watch the whole video I don't want them to like skip like right to all right let me just skip to this like single chapter only watch like what I want like I kind of want to suck them in and maybe this is like a maybe this is a bad we'll watch this whole video yes that that is what I'm thinking and uh maybe that's like not the best like user experience maybe that's just me the ingredient I don't know but uh that is how I'm going about it right now if someone has like some good data to change why uh to change my attitude on that I will happily uh listen but as of now I am not doing chat and and I've seen mixed review I've seen people who are much smarter than me let's tell you what I just told you I've also seen people who are much smarter than me actually use them on their channel so I don't think that anybody has like a a good solid answer for that how do you curate an uh an issue of Creator hooks how do you decide what goes in at that week what you talk about I imagine you are probably looking at far more videos than make it end in a typical week everything is based on a hook score and what that is is how how many views a video got above their average for the channel kind of like recent average so I'll look at you know if a video got a million views I'll look at the 10 videos like or the five videos before and after so kind of 10 videos and we'll calculate that average and I'll be like okay cool like this you know Channel averages about a hundred thousand views of video but boom this one had a million views so there's something about this video that people can learn from so the problem uh with that approach is that some channels just put out Banger after Banger and like there's like there's no deviation from the average so that is that is one problem with that so that can like take me a while where I'll just go through 10 channels and every video is a banger and it's like oh well I can't use any of these in the newsletter because like you know there's nothing telling me that this did better than the other so I have a list of like 300 channels that I I'll scroll through those 300 channels and I've had a lot of people in travel recently sign up for my newsletter so I'm trying to just find like uh outliers outlier videos in the travel industry I will go and I'll poke around I'll find like one channel that like does travel videos like I'll watch one of their videos and I'll see what's recommended and like you know are there any other channels or other kind of outliers that were recommended I'll do that process for like I don't know 20 or 30 minutes and then I'll go to my home page and it's all outlier videos of travel videos so just kind of doing that process and just playing around trying to find like just one video that blew out up and outperform the other videos on that channel so yeah so the list and just just playing around on YouTube for hours and like two three four hours on a Thursday or Friday afternoon and try to get YouTube to suggest outlier videos to me and then eventually I'll get five and I'll put those in the in the newsletter how often do you use the Curiosity plus desire or fear framework for the subject lines of your emails the whole like kind of idea behind Creator hooks is that you can use like kind of the same hooks no matter like kind of what industry you're in I just model one of the videos that were in the newsletter so last week's this new approach to YouTube will change your channel forever that was based on this video of this new approach to photography will change your channel forever you know for my email subject line I modeled a photography YouTube video title so in a sense it is a little bit you know clickbaity because it's not I'm not delivering on the title but I'm more of like kind of being an example of saying hey here is how I would use this hook and I'm going to use it in an email subject line and it's still going to get people to click and be happy they clicked I've had like three people say oh like you didn't deliver on you didn't say what you said in the in the email subject line and I've explained it to them and everyone has kind of kind of understood but yeah I'm just I'm just modeling YouTube video titles from a variety of Industries for my YouTube email newsletter and that has worked well for like 52 open rate I might try this model more closely aligned with what I am writing in the newsletter but like the Curiosity desire curiosity fear model for subject lines the problem is I try to stay within like six to eight words in a subject line so it doesn't get truncated on a mobile phone and I feel like it would be hard to do that with this model like you'd have to be real concise because you're gonna have to start with some sort of emotional language like how to or something where you aren't even talking about what's in the newsletter yet yeah that is one of the most frustrating things is like especially on YouTube just making sure uh you're kind of within those character limits a couple like reasons why that's important is like one like if it's too long you know if people are skimming they're not going to see it and two it also might get truncated you know it's the same thing with email subject lines like it depends where people are opening your email it depends where people are watching your YouTube videos if you write a really long title it's going to get truncated so that's that's definitely like one of the hardest things about writing titles is how can you pack as much like emotion and information while being like clear uh in you know less than 55 characters or whatever what we haven't talked about at all is SEO search engine optimization YouTube as a search engine how much do you think about that when it relates as it relates to titles because it seems like an opportunity that I've heard some people speak to but it doesn't sound from what we've shared so far like that's a big strategy on on your list real quick can I tell you a story going back to email subject lines I love story time all right so I have a Blog it's about Golden Retrievers and when I started to start a Creator hooks I was in the middle of a series on my blog and it was like eight month old Golden Retrievers chewing biting you know potty training then I did three month old Golden Retrievers four month old gold retrievers five-month-old golden retrievers and three and four month old Golden Retrievers the email like the click-through rate my click-through rate is like I don't know eight percent or so between like six and ten percent when I was doing kind of the boring subject lines I was just like three month old Golden Retrievers you know it's keyword stuffing my click-through rate was like four percent on those and I was like dang this stinks like what if I did the creator hooks approach to this so for five month old Golden Retrievers which is like not as like sexy as like two month old golden retrievers like because it's super new like if you have a five month old Golden Retriever now you're kind of settled in so I did why teenage golden retrievers were the worst and that doubled my click-through rate it went for like four percent to like like 8.5 or like nine percent and that was that was using negativity there it was like you know using fear like and it was also using a label like we talked about labels earlier instead of five month old Golden Retrievers it was Teenage golden retrievers so it was a little bit broader but also like still very descriptive and then I used negativity just talking about why they're the worst Ted is 10 months old right now and he is definitely the worst right now [Laughter] so you're saying right for the human don't write for the robot um I like that advice although it does seem like man there's got to be some marriage of the two because I feel like I mean the magic that I see on this channel is when YouTube is like hey we should put this on the home feed we put this in the browse features but it seems like a lot of the back catalog success right now like Justin Welsh that's succeeding on the strength of his name being searched and so I feel like there's some marriage here that I'm trying to find and it also depends on kind of where we're trying to like where we're trying to get our content shown so in the email subject line it's all like attention like kind of interruption marketing right so in that case why teenage gold retrievers are the worst like worked a lot better than kind of a another you know kind of like a boring one but when I published the blog post my subject line was five month old Golden Retrievers keyword stuffing right so it does depend on you know where you're trying to get people like if you're trying to rank in search it might be a little bit different than if you're trying to get views from like browse or like the home page or like recommended and stuff so like going back to SEO one of the things that you could do is have like kind of the main subject up front and then have like one of the click triggers like something that's going to get people a click at the end you might if we're talking about uh Justin Welsh you know how Justin Welsh so you have his name the keyword right in front you know made 10 uh you know made a million dollars in 2022 as a solopreneur or something towards the end like you have timeliness so like in 2022 you have like you know made a million dollars like a huge desire so just following up things uh following up your main subject at the end is one of a one of the better ways that I've seen people rank on search so you can use like a big desire so like made a million dollars you could use timeliness that one works really well so just like slapping the current year at the end of your title is like one of the best ways to get people to click that is most effective starting in like as early as like November to like November December it's like super effective in January like if you're I don't know when this is gonna come out but if you're planning your content like have all of your tutorials and like have all of them in January and use in 2023 in every single one and like just really pile on the in 2023 just use that strategy as much as you can in the early part of the year because every single month it's just gonna get worse like you know it's if it's like August if you publish a video that says in 2022 it's like okay like 2022 is old news right it's August it's been 2022 for eight months but like you know towards the end of the year okay now people are starting to think about ooh 2023 it's gonna be like a you know you're kind of like Trend jacking um you know newsjacking Trend surfing whatever you want to call it but it's going to be on everybody's mind so and also people like clicking on numbers so it's just like a it's a great thing to do for ranking in search you can also um include an objection you might be like uh how to get how to get stronger without lifting weights yeah right like someone's like oh man I don't wanna I don't want to lift weights but I do want to get stronger um cool I'll do that or like you know how to get hot without stopping your ice cream habit yes they're like how to get a six-pack without counting calories like boom oh that was so great I want to hear if there's anything on your mind that you have a hunch about and you're starting to research but you don't have enough data to back it up I want some some spicy give me some spicy take size to something you believe but you'd have you don't have any data to back it up yet oh so we talked about one earlier is I think that people should not use the word and in uh in titles so did you see I think it was like the writers of South Park so like the like easiest secret to write a good story is to like just use the word butt no we found out this really simple rule that maybe you guys have all heard before but it took us a long time to learn it but we can take these beats which are basically the Beats of your outline and if the words and then belong between those beats basically you got you got something pretty boring what should happen between every beat that you've written down is either the word therefore or but right so so what I'm saying is that you come up with an idea and it's like okay this happens right and then this happens No No it should be this happens and therefore this happens but this happens therefore this happens uh because there's like some conflict yeah yeah exactly but I think and it's kind of like uh dilutes a story at least in a title like when you use the word and you're saying oh cool this is about more topics than one so yeah that that is what I think I don't know if that's true or not but uh yeah I think like the more I think you know don't use the word and just make everything about one single subject another thing we could talk about is like the art versus the science of a thumbnail of a title the science is like just like modeling right so we can talk about okay cool I'm starting a new channel I'm gonna be in uh Fitness and I know that like everybody wants to um you know how to how to get a six-pack without counting calories like boom that's it's kind of science right it's like it's proven everybody makes a video or like five best chess exercises or something so science is just like modeling but then you have like the art of writing a good title and that is uh something that I'm like personally working on like really hard but I think that comes to one like being clever and two knowing your audience so one example of like the art of writing a good title is uh Leon hendricks's title uh how this dumb product made a million dollars So yeah so there's contrast between like dumb product a million dollars and that's art right like like boom like he that's very well worded you're using contrast and contrast builds a lot of curiosity but it's so much harder to teach the art rather than science I think I've kind of like studied uh this the science of writing titles really well but uh I think there are a lot of people that just have like a natural like talent for the art of writing titles much better than me so I'm trying to step up my game there but you know that is just something to uh something to kind of like you know think about and like you know if you're looking to like write a title or hire someone to write titles like you know just thinking about the art of it and also the art is like knowing your audience too so you could say how to make money online or you could say how to make ten thousand dollars a month online that's speaking to like your audience's deepest desire and um you know because a lot of people like beginners like that's like the magic number is ten thousand dollars a month if you can uh word your audience's deepest desires like better than they can then like they're way more likely to click so yeah just like the art the art and the science is uh two two interesting things um that need to kind of play around with and then there's also we talked about topic uh so the idea there's the title there's a thumbnail but there's also the Creator many people are getting this wrong as like people aren't answering the question of why should I listen to you and I got this from Alex ramosie if you can prove that you know what you're doing by like telling your stories or your experience then you are going to have way more success than somebody who is just kind of like uh just sharing what they read yes exactly I don't know like what it is about that but like people can just kind of feel it right you can just if you're listening to someone or reading someone's or like you know watching them they just feel that like you know what you're talking about you've done that you've been there versus like oh you got like really nice video and like it looks cool and like your editing is great but it's just kind of like repeated like stale content so I think that so many people are messing that up like they're they're not they're not giving their audience a great reason to listen to them they're not proving to them that they have been in the trenches and they've accomplished what your audience is trying to accomplish I think that's one thing that's holding a ton of people back I absolutely love diving into Data

"Okay, so if you can write an engaging script
for your YouTube video, viewers will watch your video for a longer duration, which can
increase video watch time, views, and overall engagement by 10 times. But if there are so many benefits to writing
a good script, then it is also a very challenging task that many YouTubers struggle with. Some can't write a good intro, some end up
with boring scripts, and some find it difficult to start writing a script altogether. So, welcome to the YouTube Script Masterclass. This is a detailed guide where I'll explain
step by step how you can write an engaging script for your YouTube videos from start
to finish, so that the audience will stick to your video, and your audience retention
will significantly improve. Even if you are a complete beginner who has
never written a script before, after this video, you'll be able to write scripts like
a pro. I will show you examples from my videos and
explain how I wrote their scripts. I will also provide some common tips about
writing scripts. So, let's begin. RESEARCH
Okay, if you can't start writing a script, then the main reason behind it might be that
you don't do enough research, and you start writing the script word by word directly. This is not the right way to write a script
because you don't have a set of information in front of you that you can use to generate
ideas and write the script. To research, the first step is to decide the
topic of your video. For example: How to Write YouTube Titles with
ChatGPT. Now, whatever the topic is, I first write
it as a heading on top of the page. For research, I recommend using a diary or
a copy because while researching, you will have many ideas in your mind, and if you write
them down on paper, you can express them better. After writing the topic of the video, now
it's time to write all the sub-topics in bullet points that you will explain in your video. For example: I needed to explain how to write
titles with ChatGPT, so I thought about the individual topics to cover in it and started
writing them down one by one. Like: the first point was whether writing
titles with ChatGPT will get more views. The second point was how to write titles with
ChatGPT, like what are the prompts, etc. And the third point was how to customize those
titles according to the YouTube algorithm. In this way, you need to mention all the sub-topics
that will come under the main topic. Similarly, for my video on 5 mistakes that
YouTubers make, I did the same: wrote the main heading and then listed all the sub-topics
in bullet points like wrong niche, bad audio, poor branding, etc. After writing these main points, I left enough
space so that I could write the sub-points under each main point. For example, under the first point, which
is wrong niche, I wrote sub-points like why YouTubers select the wrong niche, the disadvantages
of the wrong niche, and how to select the right niche, etc. Keep writing all the important sub-points
that come to your mind. Keep doing this, and you'll see that you have
written your research in a structured format. Now, see how easy it will be to write the
actual word-by-word script based on this research. But if you want to make a video based on just
these bullet points, congratulations, your script is ready. WRITING:
Okay, till now, what we have written is the research work. Now, let's talk about how to write the actual
script. If you have some basic knowledge about scripting,
you'll know that a YouTube script mainly has 3 parts: the intro, the content in between,
and the end with the call-to-action (CTA). The content part is the most important, of
course, because if you don't provide value in your video, what's the use? But even if you write the best content, if
your intro is weak, people will leave your video in the beginning. That's why, when I write a script, if I spend
10 hours on it, I spend 2-3 hours just on writing the perfect intro. For an engaging intro, you should keep in
mind that whatever you write, it should make viewers want to continue watching your video. This is called an intro hook. There are many ways to write an intro hook,
so I'll tell you 3 of them: No.1 & My Favorite: Hook people by talking
about their situation. Basically, you need to think about who your
video is targeting (meaning who is your target audience) and then think about which problem
you are solving for them (meaning what). Then, you need to say something related to
that problem that will make your video's target audience relate to it. For example: I have a video called Increase
Subscribers on YouTube By DOING THIS. Now, the target audience of this video is
YouTubers whose problem is that their subscribers are not increasing. So I thought about something like this for
the intro: Here's the word-by-word translation of the
YouTube script in English: "So, as you saw, I tried to say something
relatable at the beginning of the video, which made viewers connect with the video, and this
made them feel that because I know their problem, I also have a solution to that problem, which
hooks the viewer! You will see the same thing in many YouTubers'
intros. For example, take a look at Algrow's community
post video. The target audience of this video is YouTubers,
and their query is how to use community posts. Now, see how, by paying attention to these
things, an emotion of FEAR is cleverly created in the viewers' minds in the intro of this
video. [Video plays] It is not necessary that you always solve
the viewer's problem in every video. For example, if you are making a documentary
about a person, what problem will you solve in that? In that case, you can use hook no.2: Make
them curious. Basically, you have to make the viewers curious
by creating a question in their minds. For example, see Dhruv Rathee's video on the
theory of evolution at 28 seconds: [Video plays]
As you saw, Dhruv Rathee sparked a very good question in the viewers' minds, which hooked
them. Hook no.3: The Story Method. If there is one guaranteed method to hook
people, it is by telling a story. That story can be a real-life incident, a
fictional story, or anything, as long as it is related to the video's topic. So, again, there is no fixed formula for writing
an intro that you have to follow, but what I have mentioned are common elements in all
of them, and that is to grab the viewers' attention, intrigue them, or create an emotion
like fear, anger, or urgency in their minds. Now, another thing is that no matter how you
write the intro, make sure it is always under 90 seconds and ideally under 30 seconds. After you have written the intro hook, now
it's time to write the middle part, which is the content. Now, since we have already done the research,
writing the rest of the script will be easy because we already have the points; we just
need to elaborate on them. For this, let's take an example from this
video, which is "5 mistakes new YouTubers make." In this video, point no.2 is "bad audio,"
and I have already written its sub-points. Let's now convert it into the actual word-by-word
script. So, as you can see, the first sub-point is
that "audio is the most important thing for YouTube." I could have started directly with the first
line, saying, "Dosto audio kharab hai to use jaldi fix kro because audio is important,"
but that would have been quite boring, and the message I wanted to convey to the viewers
would not have had the same impact... So, see how I started this point: "An new YouTuber has to work on many things
in their initial days, such as lighting, audio, camera quality, editing, and much more. But if you ask me which one is the most important
among them all, I will say 'Audio.' I cannot stress enough how crucial good audio
is." Now that I have mentioned that audio is important,
in the 2nd sub-point, I have to explain why it is important, right? So, here I have also explained it: "Any viewer
can watch a low-quality video with mediocre editing if the audio is good. Whereas, the reverse is not true." And finally, the 3rd sub-point is "how to
fix bad audio," and I have also explained it: "Like I said earlier, 'What if you don't
even have a microphone? How do you record good audio without one?' Well, I have explained how you can record
good audio even without a microphone... You can pause the video to read it in detail." So, in this manner, you have to elaborate
on each point based on your research. And, of course, don't expect perfect lines
to come to your mind right away, especially if you're a beginner. It will require some patience. Also, when you write scripts, do it on some
digital platform; for example, I write my scripts in the notes app on my phone. This way, if you need to make any changes
later, you can do it easily. Now, try to create a connection between the
different points you explain in your video. This will greatly improve your storytelling. For example, in my video about "How to Write
Titles with ChatGPT," there are 2 points. The first one is "how to write titles with
ChatGPT," and the second one is "how to alter the raw title to make it a good title according
to the YouTube algorithm." To connect these two points, I wrote, "Now
that you have found a title in step 1, the question is, should you use that title or
not? This is where step 2 comes in: 'Altering the
Raw Title.' This way, the impact of my video's message on the viewers is greater,
and of course, audience retention will increase. So try to create a question related to the
next point in the viewers' minds before you start talking about a new point. This way, they will find the answer to that
question in the next point. In this way, you can connect different points. After you have written the content part, finally,
we come to the CTA, which is Call to Action, meaning an action that you want the viewer
to take towards your channel after watching your video. You can tell viewers to like the video, subscribe
to your channel, or leave a comment. You can do all of this, but the best CTA on
YouTube is to ask viewers to watch another video of yours by using end screens. To smartly incorporate end screens into your
script, you have to give viewers a reason to click on them. So, whatever topic you are making a video
on, find another video on your channel that is related to that topic and think about what
you can write there to send viewers to that other video. For example, in this video, "Increase Subscribers
on YouTube by Doing this," where I give 4 tips about increasing subscribers, at the
end, I wrote, "Alright, you got the 4 tips to grow your subscribers, but what if you
are not getting any views on your channel? In such a case, chances are you are making
some common mistakes that every new YouTuber makes. I mentioned views here, and then I wrote,
"If you want to know about these mistakes, click on the video on the screen." And then, on the screen, I had my 5 mistakes
video in the end screen. So, you have to think smartly about what you
can say that is related to your current video, and you
can then use end screens there. IMPORTANT POINTS
Okay, so you have learned how to write a script; now let's talk about some important points
that will help you in writing the script. First is to use the right language to connect
with your audience. When writing the script, make sure that the
words you use or the language you use is suitable for your target audience. For example, I know that my target audience
is mostly young people, so I use light and friendly words, and I also write my script
in a mix of Hindi and English because I think my target audience can relate to it the best. Second is to be disciplined. When we write a script, many times we don't
get the right ideas or words. In such a situation, most people get frustrated
and start procrastinating, like opening Instagram and watching reels, etc. But you shouldn't do that. You have to decide a time for writing the
script, and during that time, you should not get distracted. Even if you don't have any ideas or words
for the script, you have to sit and think. The longer you think about the topic, the
more ideas your brain will generate related to that topic. So, focus is very important. Once you get focused in the beginning, you
will achieve a flow state, and generating ideas will become easier for you. Third, take your time and avoid perfectionism. I'm sure many of you are complete beginners
who have never written a script before. I remember 2-3 years ago, when I wrote my
first word-by-word script, it took me about 4-5 days to write a script for a 5-minute
video. I'm not saying it will take you the same amount
of time, but it's quite common for beginners to face this challenge. So, take your time and avoid perfectionism. Fourth, focus more on the first half of the
video than the second half. If a viewer starts watching your video and
completes the first half, you don't have to do much to grab their attention in the second
half. Because, capturing the viewers' attention
requires more effort in the beginning. Once a viewer is halfway through the video,
even if your video is not that engaging, most people who have made it that far will watch
the entire video. So, I'm not saying you can write anything
in the second half, but I'm saying that your focus should be more on the first half
of the script. Alright, you have made it this far, so comment
"SCRIPTING IS NOW FUN," and if you liked the video, please give it a like. Also, if you want to learn editing in detail
like me, click on the video on the screen. I'll see you there, bye!"

====== Estudo_Especialista_151_YouTube Thumbnail Psychology Breakdown2 ====== 
I'm about to reveal our 20 best performing thumbnails of all time and we use this exact same thumbnail psychology to generate over $100,000 for cold em wizard if you want to see that case study it's going to be linked in the top right and it's going to be in the description but I'll get right into it before I go into it though don't steal any of my thumbnails okay I had to go as far as watermarking all of these because people steal these on Twitter it's crazy so first things first Sab subie he's a shark on Shark Tank Australia plus founder at King Kong so here for this thumbnail what we did is we said buy my course please on the right because he was essentially reviewing somebody's coar funnel and then we gave him a bit of a surprise look and then we also put a f minus and some red to really stand out the reason why we put the F minus there is just because he had a lot of things to change in his funnel overall it was good but there was definitely some recurring themes that he had to change one more thing I want to say is that we have four words in the thumbnail the reason why we did this is because if you have four words or less in your thumbnails they'll perform better right ideally you get them as close as you can to zero so next Daniel Fazio co-founder at client Ascension and multiple soft software companies so here what we did was super smart we essentially put a whole sentence in the thumbnail by only using one word steps right so here if you look at this you can clearly tell what the title is about it's three steps to get to 50 CA the method we use to put this entire sentence into a picture is this so pay attention three is just a number right it's not a word so it doesn't count so you read it from left to right so you like three steps and you're obviously going to read three steps first because it's the biggest thing in the thumbnail so it goes three steps and then the next thing you look at is the stripe screenshot cuz it goes crazy so then we say 50 c mon on it and then we also had like some really cool colors going on it really stands out compared to every other thumbnail on his channel and then we also put a green graph showing how his companies are growing over time and then he's also holding a microphone and it's a very high quality picture of them so it just looks insanely professional if you see someone with a microphone you usually think they're important so that's the exact strategy we used here super simple and yeah that's what we did next one here this one we tried to use zero words so what we did is he was explaining demand generation versus like demand capture offers so what that means is like either you're bringing more people into the funnel or you're like converting the people that are already in there so we used icons to show this these were cooking and they still cook so basically if you look at this you won't really know like what the hell he's talking about so you're going to want to click the video and see what these icons mean but if you look at this thumbnail and then you read the title it'll kind of make sense so next in this thumbnail we basically use that same green graph and then we also took Ean gaz's background you can tell by the light and then we added five icons which basically represented the five things he talked about in the video which was the macroeconomics of online business or the economics of online business something like that and he looks insanely serious right he looks like cool composed he's like explaining something the reason why this works is because people see these icons and they're like what the hell is this and then they associate these icons with success because they see the green graph in the background so they just want to watch it right we also had a little bit of red going on on the Contour and on his hair so it look pretty cool and yeah next one this is playing again on that same concept of bringing in an entire sentence into a thumbnail so we were like how to go from 0 to 50K a month and we put a timeline right so you look at this it's like you know what the thumbnail is about right you see a timeline in between his hands you see Zero you see 50 c month These are nice 3D like things in the background Nobody Does that like us so it instantly popped and that video did super good and it booked a ton of calls so next one here is going to be client retention so once again we're using four words or Less in this case we use two words and then you already know what the video is about it's like how to increase client retention got some Stars here to show positive feedback and then he looks super serious he's like counting something so that was pretty cool and then we used a bright background because when you use bright backgrounds it actually makes a significant difference versus dark background so we were doing some split testing see what's up and the light background did better so next is Luke balar this is for a live stream so basically it was a Q&A between Zack Schubert and Luke Belmar so we circled in the background net worth and we xed out some certain things this thumbnail cooked like Zach posted this on his Instagram and everybody was like yo what the hell and yeah I also signed a client off of this thumbnail so somebody saw it and was like yo we need to work together so yeah I already know this thumbnail Cooks unfortunately I don't have data for it because the video isn't public at the moment but yeah next kaib is one of our clients founder at scale clients. 411k month marketing agency so here we're talking about how to use chat gbt to sign clients and also how to use chat gbt for your Facebook ads targeting so we also did another video related to AI we were like how AI automation agencies are a scam this one cooked we also ranked it in search it was going like fourth video in the search bar at one point I think it dropped down towards like seven or eight now but yeah this this one cooked and then here D Rich we're using that same concept of four words or less in the thumbnails and also high quality pictures of the client so here we use numbers to show our outbound system is generating thousands of dollars a day so he's also on the phone so you can clearly see he's making an outbound dial so everything clicked together next thumbnail I love this one cuz Dylan just looks hilarious he's like smashing a laptop so it's like broke you know you're raging and you're making 5 CS from home and then he's on the phone so like it just looks like to make 5 cth you just have to take phone calls which is exactly true he places appointment centers and he also trains them and he places closers so yeah he's basically training people how to become sales reps from home and this thumbnail did really good this is like one of the better performing videos he's had in the last year and then next one this is basically Dylan's story from how he went from $0 per month to 100 C month usually we don't make these sorts of faces with our clients but these were already pre-shot when we onboarded Dylan so he had like his mouth open but it matches up with the theme of the video how it's sort of surprising you know going from $0 per month to 100K month not many people can do that right so next we have Barry Burns founder at top do trading he teaches people how to trade so here we like stop being unprofitable you know you're making 1.2k and then here it's like boom plus 23k and then we also had another one that's like how do you know it's time to quit your job so in instead of putting the word job on the thumbnail it's like we're putting the word into a picture right somebody with a tie he's obviously working a job right and then next is Eddie Chang this one was super good it was essentially just quitting the rat race this one cooked and cuz you know he's in like a hamster wheel and then here he's saying how he regretted going to school you see how we're essentially just taking Concepts and putting them into picture form right so here we're talking about how to start a business with $0 if you look at the thumbnail you won't really get that whole like the whole idea of the video but once you look at the thumbnail catches your attention and then you read the title it all Mak sense right and then next we're talking about how he scaled an Ecom brand from 40K a month to 300K a month in 30 days right this is one of his better case studies and he's using this to lower his closeth rates all that stuff when prospects are searching him up before sales calls they're seeing this case study and they're like okay Eddie knows what he's doing so next we have Zack shart so basically this was one of the better performing live streams on his channel where essentially we're like you have to sell this now and we blurred out Amazon and you can still tell it's Amazon right but like people want to know you know sell what on Amazon or or is it selling Amazon Services you know so they look at this thumbnail and they're like okay and then they read the title and they're like best smma service to sell right now something like that a lot of people don't know you can sell marketing to Ecom brands that are selling on Amazon so there's like Amazon SEO PPC Etc so he was talking about that and then next this is me this is a case study I scaled a coaching offer from 30k month to 75k month using YouTube and this thumbnail cooked right it's insanely simp simple and we use the same format for all our clients where you have the client on the left or the right and you're pointing an arrow towards them and you say how much they're making per month it Cooks right so yeah if you want to see more case studies I have more on my aligning page which is going to be the first link in the description if you opt in you'll get access to this document with all these thumbnails but I generated over 100k for Daniel fazo I also made an interview with him

youtube2 आरपीएम वाली कोई कैटेगरी है तो उसका नाम है फाइनेंस इस कैटेगरी पर 1000 व्यूज के बदले आप र से $ तक कमा सकते हैं एंड दिस इज वन ऑफ द मोस्ट हाईएस्ट पेइंग निशस इन youtube1 के पैसा छापना चाहते हो youtube0 निश या कैटेगरी आप चूज कर सकते हैं लेकिन रुको रुको रुको सिर्फ पैसा है इसलिए कोई भी इस नीश पर काम कर सकता है क्या क्या कोई भी फाइनेंस से रिलेटेड चैनल स्टार्ट कर सकता है जी नहीं किन लोगों को फाइनेंस रिश का चैनल स्टार्ट करना चाहिए और किनको नहीं यह अभी मैं आपको आगे बताने वाला हूं उससे पहले बात करते हैं इस के कुछ पॉपुलर चैनल्स के बारे में जो youtube2 की वीडियोस तो जरूर देखी होगी जैसे कि पुष्कर राज ठाकुर प्रांजल कामरा रचना रनाडी अंकुर वारिक फाइनेंस विद चरण ये सारे नाम ऐसे हैं जिन्होंने फाइनेंस की दुनिया में अपना एक अलग ही भोकाल मचा रखा है [संगीत] youtube2 व्यूज पर आप पा से ड लर्स तक बना सकते हैं इसलिए इन क्रिएटर्स की मंथली इनकम देखकर भी आप चौक मत जाना क्योंकि ये एक रियलिटी है ये तो वैसे इतने पॉपुलर चैनल्स है तो इनके व्यूज भी बहुत अच्छे खासे आते हैं उस हिसाब से ये इतना पैसा भी कमा रहे थे लेकिन कम व्यूज पर भी आप अच्छा खासा पैसा जनरेट कर सकते हैं इस निश पर हर महीने बिकॉज ऑफ हाई आरपीएम अब आपके मन में एक सवाल तो जरूर आएगा कि ऑलरेडी इतने बड़े-बड़े लोग इस कैटेगरी में इवॉल्वड हैं और अपना नाम बना चुके हैं तो आप एज अ न्यू क्रिएटर कैसे इस फील्ड में अपनी जगह बना पाएंगे और क्या ये निश ऑलरेडी सैचुरेटेड हो चुकी है जी नहीं आपके नॉलेज के लिए मैं एक चीज यहां पर आपको बता दूं इंडिया में आज भी फाइनेंशियल अवेयरनेस लोगों के बीच में बहुत ही कम है 90 पर से भी ज्यादा लोग आज भी अपना पैसा या तो एफडी में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं या फिर गोल्ड में और या फिर प्रॉपर्टी में और अगर बात करें स्टॉक मार्केट या म्यूचुअल फंड या फिर एसआईपी की तो इंडिया में कितने परसेंट लोग हैं जो आज भी स्टॉक मार्केट या म्यूचुअल फंड में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं ये जानकर आप शॉक्ड हो जाएंगे लेस देन 5 पर जी हां 5 पर लोग ही इंडिया में स्टॉक मार्केट में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं जबकि ग्लोबली ये एवरेज लगभग 30 टू 35 पर है तो आप समझ सकते हैं कि इसमें अभी कितना स्कोप बाकी है और जितने नए लोग इसमें आते जाएंगे उनके लिए नए क्रिएटर्स की जगह भी बनती जाएगी तो सैचुरेशन जैसी कोई चीज इसमें है ही नहीं नए लोगों की नई डिमांड जिसका मतलब है नए क्रिएटर्स के लिए जगह इसके अलावा एक और बात ऐसी है जो आपको बाकी क्रिएटर से अलग कर सकती है अगर आप देखेंगे तो मोस्टली फाइनेंशियल निश के जितने भी पॉपुलर चैनल्स है वो या तो इंग्लिश में है या फिर हिंदी में लेकिन इंडिया बीइंग सच अ डावर्स कंट्री रीजनल लैंग्वेजेस में आपको इस कैटेगरी का चैनल ना के बराबर या तो बहुत ही कम मिलेगा तो अगर आप इस कैटेगरी का एक चैनल अपनी रीजनल लैंग्वेज में बनाते हैं तो आई एम श्यर आपको इसकी ग्रोथ बहुत ही जल्दी मिल सकती है फिर वो लैंग्वेज चाहे मराठी हो कनाडा हो गुजराती हो या फिर बंगाली या

भी इस कैटेगरी का चैनल बना सकता है और काम कर सकता है बस जरूरी होगी एक चीज और वो है आपका अपना पर्सनल इंटरेस्ट इस कैटेगरी में अगर आपको फाइनेंशियल वर्ल्ड में इंटरेस्ट है और आप रेगुलरली इस कैटेगरी की न्यूज़ अपडेट्स वीडियोस देखना पसंद करते हैं तो आप बिल्कुल इसका चैनल भी क्रिएट कर सकते हैं फिर चाहे आप इंजीनियरिंग बैकग्राउंड से ही क्यों ना हो साइंस बैकग्राउंड से हो या फिर कॉमर्स इट डजन मैटर तो कैसे

====== Estudo_Especialista_34_Editing Hacks YouTubers Use To Hook You ====== 
 I dive deep into some of the biggest craters on the planet's videos and discovered five editing strategies they used to keep their viewers hooked. What you're about to read here will finally help you work out for yourself how much editing is too much editing, as well as which one of these strategies you should actually use. And after this, you're never gonna watch the David Attenborough show again the same, I'm afraid. To the start of editing strategy number one, here's how this whole thing's gonna work: every editing strategy we're going to look at has one YouTuber who rocks the extreme edit and the other who you might consider a little bit more chilled. For our first strategy, we're going to compare the way that Mr. Who's the Boss and Casey Neistat hook you with a really simple (or not so simple) trick.

So let's start with mega editor Aaron aka Mr. Who's the Boss. Is that a question? Mr. Who's the Boss, every video Aaron makes is an editing marathon. There's never a moment of stillness, anyone's listening. He wants you watching, he wants you reading. I sometimes think he wants she dancing. But why reading? Well, it's because when a word pops up on the screen, it's almost impossible not to read it. I mean, you just read this, right? And that's how he keeps your attention. 

Now, to do this yourself, you can use words on the screen that say exactly what you talk about, or just keywords that pop up to reinforce your point. And if you want to go to the next level like Aaron does, you can track him to your movement. Without a little bit of extra magic... B. Give away, you stupid bee. On the other side of the argument, we have Casey and the way he uses text isn't about saying exactly what he's just said, but actually letting the viewers read so they fill in the gaps of the story to work out what he's doing. So let me show you what I mean with this clip. In this video, Casey's off to South Africa and he's talking about how he has to take multiple flights. And when he arrives in South Africa, instead of just saying "to, we're here," the jazz ensues. He points his camera at the text on a sign in the airport and leaves it on there long enough for the viewers to read and fill in the blanks. So he's making the viewer do some work to piece together what is happening, rather than just handing them everything on a plate. And actually, Casey uses text quite a lot, but you wouldn't really feel like he does because it's nearly always physical and filmed rather than typed in and animated, which makes the content feel more authentic and actually essentially not easy to edit, too.

So which style should you use? The real life text or the graphic text? Well, I have an answer for you, but it's going to make a lot more sense when you understand the next four points, because I'm not gonna lie. It's the same answer for these next points, too. So let's move on to battle Ryan Triana and Johnny Harris. So Johnny Harris, if you don't know who he is, is a bit of a YouTube legend because he answered the question that has been keeping you up at night. Why are McDonald's ice cream machines always broken? If you've been in the UK, he would have been knighted for that bad boy. Now, one thing Sir Johnny is known for is his maps. He films them, but actually it's his motion graphics of them. The viewers are really wowed. Boy, they are the video equivalent of butter melting in your mouth. Alright, that is just not as nice as it sounds. And then there's Ryan Tran, and his graphic of a map. This is one of the biggest and most respected YouTubers on the planet, and he made this in a world where Johnny Harris' quality exists. How does Ryan get away with this utter disgrace? Well, a few reasons, but the one I want to focus on can be made clear when I simply switch Johnny's map onto Ryan's video like this. "I'm headed to this tiny little town that's going to allow me to boat to the island. This is not your average Uber ride." You see the problem? Ryan's graphics actually is equally engaging because they're so simple, but more importantly, they match the tone of the rest of his video. It's authentic. And Johnny just couldn't use a crowd like this because you would never trust him. Because it would be the wrong time when talking about a really serious subject like, "Why the ice cream machines won't work?" or "Why do you wouldn't kill us?" That's a better example. All of his credibility would just fly out the window. But it's the same for Ryan. If his videos suddenly took these ultra swish graphics and put them on one of his highly playful videos that he kept basic for a reason, the viewer can lose trust, too. Because they didn't sign up for something super serious. 

Which brings us to the next editing strategy. One most YouTubers probably wouldn't even think they could achieve, but they can. Honest. And I'll prove it to you. I will, I will. Two editors who are battling out are Gorksa and Colin and Samir. So, the problem the average YouTuber has is that it's just them on camera. But why is that a problem? I've actually touched on this in videos before, but I'm gonna go a bit deeper. So name one amazing film that only has one character in it. And don't say "Cast Away". Wilson was a character. And don't say "Two... the silent French film from the 1920s" because I just made. It up characters make stories more interesting because viewers can gravitate towards one a lot more than another. When you double your characters, you double your chance of keeping your viewers interested. But if it is just you, how can you bring in a character? Well, I'm going to show you using editing. This is how Gorks did it: he made himself into multiple people using the Clone effect. I've done this quite a few times in film. With two on the chilled edit side, Colin and Samir have multiple characters in every video because there are two of them. So when they edit, they just make sure they don't cut one of them out. Super basic editing there. But also, they bring in tons of other people to their show, even their second Channel, which is a lot simpler, is designed around characters. Because they host it but get the questions from the audience to then get involved in the comic character. So the chilled edit version of this could just mean you bring in more people, and the extreme edit could make anyone or anything a character. Isn't that right Wilson? Wilson? Wilson, where's Santa? Yo, man. Oh, got me worried. Sorry, man. I just been chilling with my homies. Where did you learn to talk like that? Tom Hanks. B sounds absolutely nothing like that. You've been tripping. Moving on to editing strategy number four. Yeah, four. And this time we're battling out Mr. Who's the Boss and Casey. Again, looks like I got a bit lazy with my research there. No one will notice. Just don't make it too obvious. But maybe there's a reason I use them again. Anyway, let's start by looking at this opening scene from Aaron's video. Look at all that information we have. The numbers down the side, we have Aaron on the right. We have a split screen on the left. There's just so much going on. Meanwhile, in Casey land, we have just one thing at a time. Really, what they're both doing is their own version of this next editing strategy, which is all about showing rather than telling. So, this is like the golden rule for video. The more you show, the better. It builds credibility, intrigue, and it builds story. And it lets the viewers work things out for themselves. The highly edited version of this is designed to be a sensory overload, in the same way the Avengers films are. I mean, look at how much Aaron is just showing us here. It's crazy. And he's like, "Oh, this guy must know his stuff, because there's just tons of info." Casey's approach is, well, he wants you to focus on only the thing that matters. So, in the edit, he has to decide what that thing is, to best show rather than tell, to fill in the gaps of his story. So, remember the text from earlier when he held the shot, so you could read the sign? That was the showing bit. And why I must have used it again as an example in this video. Not because I'm a very lazy man. Which brings us on to our next editing hooks battle, between IREK and Natalie Lin. And if you've not seen Natalie, you're missing out. Let's start by looking at IREK's strategy here. Who's also very good. So, his videos are super fast-paced, energetic, and fun. And one of the things that adds to the whole viewer's experience and helps hooks them is that whoosh, that boom, pressure. Oh my God, the noise. It all adds another dimension, the crazy Avengers style sensory overload, and it helps to build the emotion, the pace, and the excitement that keeps people interested. And it might surprise you to know that those noises, they don't actually exist in real life. Apart from that one time, thank you. But on the chilled editing side, we have Natalie Lin. Those sound effects you can hear right now, well, they do exist in real life, except they don't. I don't want to ruin every David Attenborough show ever for you here, but he also has the same editing strategy as Natalie. The noises you hear in his animal shows, they're not real either. They don't mic up a duck, not after the incident. Now you're never gonna unsee that when you watch some of these shows. But the reason IREK and Natalie use fake sounds that sound real is because of this. If I use this noise on this clip, the viewers will suddenly lose trust and get pulled out of the story. They could even feel a little bit lied to. Because now, these videos are raw and very personal. Clearly fake sounds would burn that trust too, and it would wreck the stories. Having thus, no longer moving on to editing strategy number five. We're gonna battle Emma Chamberlain against entertainment YouTuber, Preston. And this strategy, when you get it wrong, can really do a heck of a lot of damage. So let's start with Emma's use of it. This video has eight million views, and the first four minutes have no editing, other than just a straight cut of her poking her head out of a bathtub. That's it. Preston's channel, we have this. He makes sure that every single second has some kind of movement going on. From the camera movement to transitions to jump cuts. And actually, when Emma does intentionally throw in some edited movement in her videos, it's done in this kind of Cheesy way, where the viewer knows it's supposed to be cheesy. The thing is, her lack of movement is just as an intentional choice as Preston's hype edit, because she wants the main focus to be on what she's saying, not all of the crazy exciting things going on around. Her, she just has to trust that her viewers will want to listen without trying to trick him into it. And to maintain an authentic tone, you can't go and throw in loads of manufactured excitement. And that's actually one of the biggest problems I see with hype editing. People tend to apply it to content that it just doesn't fit with because they think retention is all about editing effects. And it's just not at all. It's a lot more about the way you order your information and the creative ways you work out how to get that message across. So, what kind of editor should you be and which one of these strategies should you use? Well, actually, you should use all of them. Every YouTuber I just showed you, no matter what side of the argument they're on, is actually doing the same thing as their polar opposite. They all use text characters showing, not telling, sound, movement, and these really are the basics to master. So, the thing you have to ask yourself isn't which one do I use, but how do I work out how far I take them? And so you can answer that question for yourself. I'm gonna read you what might be the hottest take on editing of all time, but it's really going to help you pick your side. Recently, this message popped up on my Twitter, and I don't manage to verify it. But either way, it makes my point perfectly. It's supposed to be a message from Casey Neistat where he's talking about making YouTube videos. Now, it's quite a long message. The first half just completely tears into hype editing. But this was the line that I think matters the most for you when Casey says, "The best steakhouses in the world serve their fillet on a plate with nothing else. Shitty franchises cover theirs in sauce to distract you from the fact you're eating dog food." But I actually have a problem with this because I like franchise food covered in sauce. And when I go into a posh steakhouse, I ask for ketchup because who are you to tell me how I can eat my food? You do not have my taste buds. And that's editing. Billions of viewers all around the world will all have different tastes. All you have to do is ask yourself, "What kind of viewer do I have? The billions who love franchise food or the kind they eat their steak raw?" Think about your viewer's expectations when they click the tone you want to create, style like they'll trust with your idol audience. And then just choose a side, edit for them and forget everyone else because no matter which side you pick, someone probably will not like it. So live by the ethos "You do you boo" and you'll be okay without an ethos. But there's actually something else I've not spoken about that makes a really huge difference to your video's tone and energy. And I don't think enough emphasis is put on this because if you get good at this, you could potentially edit less but still maintain energy. So to learn how two gigantic YouTubers use this to build their channel to millions of subscribers, watch this video next because it's good, even though I say so myself. I mean, Aaron actually commented and said it was good too, so the.

====== Estudo_Especialista_47_how to create a killer youtube video (to blow up your channel) ====== 
this is how to design and create a killer youtube video to blow up your channel because one or two or three killer youtube videos have the potential to dramatically change your channel forever look closely because many creators got their big break because they had just one great video go viral but what makes a great video what do these successful creators know that we don't is it the camera they're using is it the editing software do they have better equipment obviously they know something we don't and we need to figure it out because the fastest growing creators in the world know how to blow up their channel which is three or four killer videos good news for us it's actually quite simple and it doesn't require any fancy equipment or film school experience because the process great creators use to design and create killer youtube videos follows a couple steps and this video will walk you through all of them practice this regimen daily for three months and your youtube channel and your life might change dramatically if you're new to the channel welcome because you're home and to be honest we need you subscribers to this channel are youtube creators making the world a better place with their videos and the world needs your positive influence as a creator before you ever touch a camera you need to plan your video and figure out why people will click on your video in the first place because nothing feels worse than if you film edit you make the highest quality video in the world it's funny it's hilarious it's beautiful it's literally perfect except no one wants to click it this likely means your video was an uninteresting idea ooh that sounded way harsher than i expected for example here is one of youtube's featured rising creators take a look at these videos they've done and which one has way more potential to get over a million views and to blow this channel up is it the one about dog park friendly rules in yosemite or is it the one about how they moved full time into an airstream one of these applies to like maybe a thousand people in the world while the other one appeals to a much bigger audience or what about this yoga channel which video has more potential to get over a million views is it ankle mobility exercises or is it going to be yoga for men one applies to a much smaller audience than the other or let's look like a filmmaker channel same question which video has way more potential to blow this channel up and get it thousands if not hundreds of thousands of new subscribers before you ever even think about touching a camera or an editing software do you see how important it is to have a killer idea in the first place but we usually skip the part about coming up with a great idea and just go straight to filming and editing right don't be afraid to spend days or even weeks coming up with killer video ideas because literally anyone with a killer video idea and the skills to execute it will blow up for years when i've worked with youtube channels they always are so concerned about oh how do i publish every week or even every day what most of them never realized until we worked together is that one killer video will outperform 10 average ones you can get way better results with way less effort and just a month ago mr beast literally confirmed the exact same thing with joe rogan livingston video with million views and 30 million views the video with 30 million views usually didn't put in 30 times the effort like they might have put in two or three times the effort and just had a way better idea does that make sense yes and so the idea is so freaking important like you could theoretically most youtubers watching this you could pull triple the views with half the work if you just have better ideas like no joke it's that extreme and so once you realize how important an idea is you just obsess over well how do i get more ideas how to get better ideas for me i sketch out ideas on an app i made called planner vid that way i can take a step back and ask are these killer video ideas does this feel like a 100k subscriber channel listen to that intuition and feel it compare your channel to other successful channels in your niche and note the differences if you're like me when i started youtube you probably had an idea in your head got your camera filmed it edited it uploaded it to youtube and then you realized oh yeah i guess i need a title and a thumbnail so you scrape something together pretty fast and slap it on youtube because after all you made a great video so the title and thumbnail they're not actually as important as the actual video right here that's a self-centered way of creating youtube content you're thinking like you not like your audience look your viewers don't see the great video behind the click all they see is a title and thumbnail that's all they have to go off of if they are intrigued no one will click and your video will get like 12 views all from you smashing the refresh button speaking of smashing buttons now would be a good time to well you know the rest whereas most of us creators will create our title and thumbnail the very last part the best creators in the world do it very first look mr beast and mark roberts start with a title and thumbnail they know that if they can make a killer tnt they know their audience will want to click on that guides their filming editing everything start with the title and thumbnail instead of doing a last so what makes a great title here are some common titles we often see youtubers make life update how to succeed in life if you make a life update video that only applies to a maximum the number of current followers you have so if you've only got 800 subs that life update video is only going to potentially be interesting to a maximum 800 people for a killer video that can blow up your channel we want a video that can interest and intrigue up to 8 million people alright so let's tweak this title just a little or a lot junior software engineer and youtuber a typical day in my life do you feel the difference here do you see how this can appeal to like at least a million people now sure maybe it's still a life update in a lot of ways and stuff but change that title and you can appeal to so many more people now this video on the other hand is way too general and broad and unspecific and it doesn't intrigue me at all let's change it up what to do when you fall short of your goal motivational do you feel the difference in that video these aren't just titles anymore these are killer titles with the potential to blow up a channel now time for the other half thumbnails because you're not creating just a title and you're not designing just a jpeg image you're creating one whole title and thumbnail designed to create interest and intrigue for the viewer to want to click i like to sketch thumbnails on a paper or an ipad alongside a title that way when it's time to pick up a camera or photoshop i already know exactly what i want to create and i'm constantly keeping that holistic view of the video rather than just its individual parts so take a look at these average thumbnails and then compare them with these super successful thumbnails what's the big difference how come people are clicking these thumbnails instead of these ones it's not image quality or aesthetic my guess would be to take a look at the title and the thumbnail as a whole these two thumbnails are just restating what's already in the title there's no like additional interest or intrigue to want to click these two thumbnails on the other hand complement the titles there's a simple title that interests me and the thumbnail creates intrigue yeah i'm interested in a million dollars and i'm intrigued because did noah just go up to random doors and ask i'm interested in learning how to survive falling from a plane and i'm intrigued because i thought the answer was to keep your legs straight keep your legs straight when you hit the water i'll keep my legs straight spike but by stating what i should not do the thumbnail is implying that it does know the answer so now i'm double intrigued i'm gonna click on both of these videos because i'm interested and intrigued here unfortunately i'm not interested in the confusing title nor am i intrigued by the thumbnail that i can't really tell what's going on and this video i'm interested in because i never thought jpeg was horrible and now i'm super intrigued because oh my gosh is that the image quality difference i have to click and learn what i've been doing wrong all these years interested intrigued when planning my title and thumbnail one exercise i like to do is i like to close my eyes and for several minutes i'll keep my eyes closed while envisioning myself going to click on a video to watch it what's making that video feels so intriguing to me that i'm going to click and watch it what is the title and thumbnail of that video i'm seeing and when the title comes to me i type it out and draw out the thumbnail i see and that works about 50 of the time if when i type out the title it just doesn't look right or doesn't feel right to me then i just go through the same process again once you're like 90 sure that your idea and your title and thumbnail are killer then you can get on to actually making the video scripting is what i spend the most time on and when done properly it will make filming and editing easier here's the template i use when scripting and there's a google doc below that you can make a copy of depending on the type of video you're making there's generally three questions that will guide your scriptwriting process when you answer these three questions effectively you can write a killer script if you're making an educational or tutorial video always ask this question first what do you want the viewer to do to get them the result they're looking for then what do they need to feel emotionally to take that action then finally what does the viewer need to know for example when making this video my goal was for you the viewer to make a killer youtube video to blow up your channel and to practice and then you need to feel inspired that you can make a killer video that you can turn your motivation into momentum to do and to feel those things you need to know the minimal process to plan script film edit and grow now i will constantly refer back to these answers that i wrote down because every single line of my script needs to somehow point back to these answers and if it doesn't it gets cut if i were making a gardening tutorial video man i'm really into gardening lately maybe my do feel and know would look like this or if i'm a gaming channel showing off the best speedrun tactics and legend of zelda my do feel and know would look like this if you're making an entertainment video then these are the questions you'll ask instead what's the big interesting idea of the video what does the viewer need to feel while watching then finally what does the video need to include to be entertaining for example if i was writing a script for davey 504 here's how i would answer the questions for him or if i'm isaiah photo here's how i'd answer these questions these answers will guide your entire script writing process every single line of your script should somehow point back to these answers the first and most critical section of the video is the hook and intro too many youtubers think an intro means a branded video sequence look there's a reason netflix lets you skip intros nowadays no one cares intros for the most part just satisfy the ego of the creator they want some fancy brand and intro that helps them feel legit the first seconds of your video need to create congruency between the title and the thumbnail in the intro look the viewer clicked on your video hoping for something so if you can give them exactly what they're expecting from your title and thumbnail odds are they will like and watch your entire video all of that is decided in your hook and intro see how mr b starts this video there's total congruency between the title and the thumbnail and the intro or how isaiah photo starts his video again total congruency between the title and the thumbnail and the intro in the first three seconds of your video you want the viewer to think this is exactly what i was expecting hi it's uh it's me john the editor and so i was sitting here editing this video about to publish it before i realized that for this hook and intro i forgot the most important crucial thing you should know about a hook and intro if you were to do this thing it would ruin your whole youtube career never ever start your hook and your intro to your video like this sup guys welcome back to the channel so glad you're here but first i would just love and appreciate it if you could hit that like button and that subscribe button just it just helps me so much basically just on here for people to help me and now i've wasted about 30 seconds of your time and i haven't helped you i've just asked for you to help me this whole time all right so hopefully that was obvious as to why you should never start your hook and intro like that because why don't instead you figure out what can i give to someone else instead of just trying to focus on you the whole time now i'm going to get back to editing this video so that way you guys can see it very very soon during or after script writing make notes to the site of each section of what visuals you want i typically categorize visuals like talking head close-up punch in on-screen text type animation or whatever makes sense for you realize you'll need multiple revisions and drafts your first draft of your script is not going to be so great but it's so much easier to come back and edit something that's already there rather than trying to get it perfect on your first try this is my biggest struggle but i'm seeing little improvements in myself as i let go of perfectionism and learn to just get out a rough draft without being critical the first draft takes the longest for me but then the second and third drafts take a fraction of the time the more time you spend scripting the less time you'll spend filming and editing there are a thousand greek tutorials on youtube showing you how to film with a phone or a dslr or a gopro or whatever so i'll focus on principles filming should go really fast because now you have a shot list or you're about to i take all the visuals from the script copy and paste them into a spreadsheet then group shots by location i keep this spreadsheet with me when filming then everything goes fast and efficient show don't tell whenever possible use visuals instead of your words for example too many amateurs film a vlog like this good morning so i woke up and then i got a shower and then i brushed my teeth and then i made breakfast i am here about to start my day i'm so glad you guys are here and make sure to hit the like and subscribe button because really it just it just helps me out so much and whatever you could do to help me i would just love that so much you're just chronologically telling us what's happening watch this great example of show don't tell from sam kolder now midway through the shoot i had the idea to add in a match cut sequence focused on the lens of one of the phones so i had built a little custom wooden rig to hold the phones together and captured footage of the phone in a bunch of different locations i ended up loving the final look of it and i'm stoked that i ended up following through with that idea see how sam didn't have to explain where he was going instead of telling us he showed it andre jake makes videos about finance nothing is more boring than numbers and facts and statistics unless you're a nerd like me which is why every single statistic is reparated visually by andrei and broken up occasionally with funny camera stuff think of every possible creative way to show your story start paying attention to other youtubers and what angles and methods they use and just have fun with it hopefully if you did your script right beforehand this filming part went super fast for you editing is one of the most vital parts to any video and along with coming up with the killer idea and a killer title and thumbnail pacing is absolutely critical to a killer youtube video to blow up your channel because when you click on a video what's the only reason you'll stop watching only if it was boring in other words the pacing is off the viewer lost interest and now the viewer is clicking the back button pacing is even more important for youtube than it is for like big screen movies in the theaters because if you pay money to watch a movie you'll sit through it even if it starts to suck but for youtube if i'm bored or uninterested for even like five seconds i'm bouncing and watching something else re-watch your edit over and over and over and over again and pay attention to where you get bored or lose focus those are usually the parts that need to be re-edited or cut completely every single second of your video needs to somehow add value to the viewer lengthy 10-second branded intro cut it out unnecessary dead space cut it out to write is human but to edit is divine why take 20 minutes to get your point across when you can effectively do it in five every story is collapsible to some degree if you can't cut out 10 percent you're not trying very hard i know there's bits of the video you so badly want to have in there but if it doesn't contribute to the point of the video cut it out look even for me there's bits of every video that i make that i think is the greatest thing in the world but here's the thing these videos aren't about me these videos are about you so every single line i say and every shot i show is designed to help you believe in yourself you can make great videos if you want it and you want it badly your youtube success it doesn't depend on where you're from it doesn't depend on how much money you have it just depends on can you get someone to click on your video and to watch or enjoy your whole video i know this may seem like a lot when you first attempt it and it may feel hard so if there's anything you should take away for how to design and create a killer youtube video to blow up your channel it's killer idea killer title and thumbnail and perfect pacing take your time to get these things right and get better results with less effort no long-term goal is sustainable unless you enjoy it the only reason i consistently go to the gym go for long runs eat a healthy diet say prayers and read scripture every morning and keep making youtube videos is because i enjoy the process if planning and creating a youtube video is miserable for you you're not gonna stick with it and if you enjoy the journey and process of designing and creating killer youtube videos you're already a success you don't gotta wait for some future arbitrary subscriber account you're already a success right now the subscriber count yeah that'll come later so to help design and create killer youtube videos i made this web app called plannervid i'm using it for my own channel too and i've got lots of videos planned but what do you guys think of these upcoming videos and the last video got 1700 likes which is nuts so do you guys think we can match that again

====== Estudo_Especialista_64_How to Make a YouTube Thumbnail in 5 Minutes ====== 
is how to make great thumbnails for YouTube in just five minutes let's start the timer here we go the first thing we want to do is get the shot so for this video got a basketball this is my little prop we are making a hypothetical YouTube thumbnail for a video called how to shoot like Steph Curry so I want to actually record this on my phone and I'm gonna not use the self timer I just think it's gonna be easier and faster if I shoot in 4k at 60 frames per second I'm going to hit record and 60 frames per second is going to be more pictures within the second for me to choose from so got my light right here I'm just going to hit a couple poses maybe like I'm shooting the ball I just want to hit a few different angles you don't want to just settle for one and then you can see what looks best later so I'm gonna hit a few more maybe this side okay we have four minutes left a little over four minutes so I'm gonna stop filming here and now I'm gonna open this up and I'm gonna send this over to my laptop so we are going to airdrop this I'm gonna hit next airdrop I'm gonna send this to my laptop where I'm gonna then going to edit on canva thank you very much canva for sponsoring this video and they make it super easy actually to edit thumbnails and I'll show you some of my favorite features here but as the timer is just ticking down I'm gonna open up canva.com hit create a design then we're gonna go to YouTube thumbnail now that this is open we are going to find this uh video that I just sent to myself and from here I'm going to open this up I'm then going to scrub through this and I'm going to find the image that I want to use for my thumbnail so this one looks pretty good the ball is kind of cut off right there so maybe I'll use it right about there but I also hit a few more options so I'm over here and it's ball is kind of shattering my face so I'm going to use this one right here looks perfect so I'm going to go ahead and pause and then scroll rub over oof this is great so now we have a very high quality you know definitely high quality enough for YouTube of a photo for a thumbnail so I'm going to use that screenshot now and pull this into go to my desktop and I'm going to pull this in right here perfect so now with this inside of canva I'm just going to make this a bit bigger I'm going to go to edit photo and this is one of my favorite features in canva is we're going to hit the background removal and it literally just takes a few seconds you can see how clean this looks now we only have two minutes and 15 seconds left so we need to keep going basically what I want to do at this point is add in my background I'll make this a little bit bigger I'm going to add in my background so I'm going to go on Google I'm going to type in outdoor basketball court and from here I'm just going to find a good image that I can throw behind me and something that is pretty simple this one's going to be perfect so I'm going to copy this image I'm going to throw it into canva I'm going to paste it right here and then I'm going to right click and we are going to put this backwards I'm going to send it backwards I'm going to make this a lot bigger and you can see this is already looking pretty cool for just a few minutes spent like this is already looking uh amazing and so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna blur the background to help me kind of pop off the background a bit more more and canva makes it super easy there's these effects down here there's a blur option so I'm going to click blur and from here I can just change the intensity feel like that looks really good so now this is just uh nice and beautiful I'm going to click back on my image and I'm going to go to the adjustments and from here this is where I can change the color I can change the brightness and that's what I'm going to do is see you know the color temperature I can make it a little bit warmer I think that looks pretty good I can change the brightness here I'm going to maybe add in some more contrast I think that's going to look a little bit better a little more contrasty and we can mess around with the saturation maybe actually bring the brightness down just a little bit more and the contrast down just the hair and then once you dial that in I like to add a little bit of sharpness not too much but this just makes it easier to see on YouTube when they're super tiny it's hard to see so with 40 seconds left let me add in some text I'm gonna go to text I'm just going to throw this one in right here and I'm going to change this to shoot like Steph Curry and this is already looking pretty great I'm going to delete this one down here um and honestly this is looking really good I want to change it to White and that looks awesome but we do want to go to effects add in a nice shadow I can change the blur here we definitely want the shadow to be black and this is looking really really cool being a little bit closer bring the transparency up and I can even change it to the font we use at think media which is this one dang this is looking fire with three seconds left this is a really good YouTube thumbnail that we just made in five minutes and it looks really really good so if you want to try canva out make sure you use the link down in the description thank you so much for sponsoring this video I love canva for producing super quick thumbnails just like this so check it out and we'll see you guys in the next video

when you visit the YouTube homepage you guys are bombarded by countless thumbnails crafted by really skilled designers with huge budgets and really making you feel overwhelmed especially if you're a solo Creator like me I was curious about how top creators consistently go viral so I dedicated weeks to gather the most engaging thumbnails surprisingly I discovered that almost all of them can be grouped into just 20 categories number one the shock and awe genre creators like Tyler Aliva have achieved these huge success the effectiveness of such thumbnails lies in their extremeness whether you guys like it or not the YouTube homepage often FS like this amusement park where like the fastest and most thrilling rides grabs all the attention to illustrate this consider two most identical examples videos about being buried alive surprisingly the smaller Channel posted theirs a month earlier and the key difference is that Jimmy's face is just larger and easier to read especially with the Vivid green grass that really stands out especially in the dark mode prefer by 80% of the viewers mod details like this make a huge outcome number two often the most shock value could be from a large amount of something just like a 100,000 bouncy balls or an object that just costs super expensive these thumbnails Place big numbers front and center betting on them getting your attention not surprisingly they are pretty common in the finance space here in a tour of the world's most expensive car you guys noticed to a million communicated the insane price tag another common feature these thumbnails is avoiding perfectly rounded numbers because it's really easy to lose a sense of skill when they are too many zeros number three reaction videos remain highly popular frequently gracing the trend tab with their eye catching thumbnails the common layout involves displaying the content being reacted to while also positioning the Creator's face on either side people like Mr Beast doesn't really bother switching the photo most of the time cuz it's usually the same thing a really interesting Trend I noticed is that podcasters are doing with a react genre like h3h3 who will react to things live only to be edited into highlight Clips these podcasters can pull off really cool and reaction thumbnails that aren't limited to any specific genre creators are around YouTube will react to just about anything number four utilizing quotes and thumbnails is a underrated trick by featuring a quote that highlights The crucial moments from the video viewers instantly grasp on what to expect whether you guys are aiming for humor or providing contexts quote thumbnails are seen in videos like Brian Johnson's video and this is something that's likely to capture way more attention this year take a moment to spot one in your homepage and consider clicking on one of my videos next time number five just like the quotes question thumbnails play a crucial role take the Science Show by Hank Green for instance almost boosting nearly 8 million subscribers despite my intentional interest of science his videos managed to repeatedly appear on my homepage these thumbnails pose a simple question embedding it into the viewers mind compelling them to find the answer by watching the video while it may seem pretty straightforward experien creators know the effectiveness of packaging involving more than just text questions question thumbnails works best when the title Sparks his curiosity and the hook after clicking keeping you guys engaged in wanting more of it I ended up watching the entire video and went to binge a few more videos and by the way guys if you guys want to learn how to repeatedly go viral on YouTube I made a PDF blueprint called the viral video chich Chi which is free for you guys to download the link is in the description below number six what if your thumbnail is the solution and the title is the question I call this title the Jeopardy thumbnail if the question appears controversial or surprising you might be on to something many people believe the incredible health benefits of Sal lamps but veritasium strongly disagrees this video boldly asks do salt lamps even work the thumbnail answers with a no Kurt s go questioning whether you could fix climate change the thumbnail response with a no but there is an aster with it the entire explanation in the video is a clever approach that makes you guys want to watch to get the full details number seven popular YouTubers like lugwig use controversial thumbnails inspired by Beluga these thumbnails based on Discord are distinctive for a few reason reasons firstly their layouts font and colors are easily recognizable to the target audience especially those familiar with Discord in the SE of flashy thumbnails with red arrows these thumbnails offer something that's fresh and recognizable making them stand out on the homepage number eight when establishing a business strong branding is crucial for converting new viewers into loyal ones while everyone should consider their branding when creating thumbnails let's explore a few examples the digital income project stands out with custom 3D renders in high quality Photoshop work maintaining this tronik theme and glow effect these creators use borders to really set themselves apart like Jeff FM who adopts for a simple logo placement at the bottom left and if you're familiar with the CEO diary you likely notice their signature black backdrop white tag and red border these examples showcase the importance of a strategic branding in attracting and retaining viewers number nine CEO diary is along the top performers on the platform excellent in Social acting it's important to recognize the influence of of familiar faces social hacking involves leveraging the likeliness of a well-known individual that your audience recognize the CEO diary effectively utiliz a strategy featuring successful figures such as Cole sprouts Russell bran and also Robert Green however they are not the only one doing this in 2020 airra went viral in a social hacking collaboration with major creators with even less than 20,000 subscribers number 10 Ryan tryan's famous video the world's quietest room features a new thumbnail Style known as the high contrast thumbnail in this format trayon stands out in the orange jumpsuit against the dark room backdrop this makes the image captivating in Tran's subtle expression he avoids exaggerating emotions making it feel and portray authentic this approach has influenced other creators such as arak and also Mr Beast to adopt the same techniques number 11 in this thumbnail by Matt Wolf the text at the top serves as the header hence the term header thumbnail consider using this approach for thumbnails that require this additional cont context through text and this is a popular choice on YouTube particularly when it comes to textual explanations are needed to conoid an image meaning this technique is effective for thumbnails that benefit from a bit more explanation through words number 12 E mark Rober incorporates a header thumbnail in his videos often including Arrow or Circle sometimes both the format typically features this main element with the Creator Often by the frame although it's not really that visible the text and arrow directs the attention to the focal point and another variation involves a group of people wearing this same attire with a Creator standing out in the center all these variations share this common theme of using arrows and circles to guide the viewers attention and I'm not going to lie guys this actually my go-to style for my thumbnails and my other YouTube channels that I manage if you guys want to see how I was able to scale YouTube channels for other people make sure you guys hit the Subscribe button and a notification Bell to stay up Tod dat when I drop my next video 13 thumbnail Transformations like the ones that you guys see here are a widespread and popular format the main concept is to visually convey a progression or change over time tempting the viewers to click and discover the story behind it transformational thumbnails often spark this curiosity because they prompt the viewer to wonder how the change actually occur and somebody that does this really well is John kougan in the history series and these thumbnails kougan effectively uses the transformational format to engage his audience the alert really lies in the viewers that actually really want to uncover The Narrative or the process leading to the final outcome this technique is a common and yet effective strategy as it Taps into our natural instincts to seek stories behind visual Transformations 14 compare two things in side-by-side formats like showcasing cheap versus expensive items is a common practice this types of thumbnails often feature products such as Mac versus Windows or Pepsi versus Coke can attract a broad audience it's a great strategy to engage fans on both sides encouraging them to actually watch and share their opinions in the comments thus boosting the engagement 15 creators often hide video context by blurring the thumbnail known as the unknown thumbnails I noce that YouTube videos that cover like fiber Freelancers tend to use its technique they may include some comparison videos such as cheap versus expensive but it's crucial to not disappoint viewers with uninteresting content when pixelating the thumbnail it's essential to Captivate the viewers early in the video closing the Curiosity Loop in the intro and consistently delivering interesting content throughout the video well-crafted thumbnails just like these can lead to impressive clickthrough rates 16 every thumbnail in this video features this weird strange object inciting viewers to really click and explore Leon Hendrick generated almost 2 million views using this unique thumbnail strategy providing its Effectiveness across various niches for example a coffee Channel also experienced this crazy success by employing a quirky thumbnail showcasing an unusual coffee brewer the key here is making that weird object speak for itself driving curiosity and engagement whether your audience is big or small this unconventional approach of incorporating a weird we object in the thumbnail could capture attention and boost viewerships it's a simple and yet effective technique that keeps viewer curious and eager to discover more 17 thumbnails aren't always focused on just objects sometimes they highlight creators actions to engage with viewers these are called bring along thumbnails featuring the personality based creators just like Emma Chamberlain and her videos centering around her and her activities rather than being something over the top yet she manages to entertains and share her compelling stories even when doing Medan tasks like C her hair captivating the audience surprisingly Casey Nan most viewed video is a bringalong vlog that has over nearly 80 million views 18 a thumbnail should be self-explanatory but adding context is essential successful thumbnails in this category balance between visually engaging and easy to understand many YouTube subreddits feature confusing and cluttered thumbnails which is a common mistake but the key here is to ensure the cutouts are quickly recognizable to the target audience ideally there should be only one essential element for viewers to focus on for example this thumbnail by hdhd highlights Ethan by making him larger than the others effectively separate him from the background 19 of course if cutout thumbnails are a hit the flip side single photo thumbnails are equally as trendy though they may seem straightforward creating them requires a little bit more planning than a usual thumbnail Matt Dila sets a trend with his outstanding thumbnails he skillfully conveys video topics with one image skillfully using items just like a laptop pen paper headphones and a coffee cup to represent productivity this format goes behind the surface gaining popularity for its laser focus reability and also Effectiveness number 20 in 2024 we see this new style of thumbnails that is making you guys stop and click on videos subconsciously low effort thumbnails yep you guys heard that right but more specifically is stick figure thumbnails recently we
